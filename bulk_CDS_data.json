GRUAN measurements are providing high-quality climate data records from the surface, through the troposphere, and into the stratosphere. These are being used to determine trends, constrain and calibrate data from more spatially comprehensive observing systems (including satellites and current radiosonde networks), and provide appropriate data for studying atmospheric processes. GRUAN is envisaged as a global network of eventually 30-40 sites that, to the extent possible, builds on existing observational networks and capabilities.\n\nGRUAN observation processing is designed to adjust systematic errors in radiosonde measurements of pressure, temperature, humidity, and wind, and to quantify how the uncertainties related to these error sources are derived. This characterization ensures the traceability to SI units or accepted standards, providing extensive metadata and full documentation of measurements and algorithms.\nThis allows the full reprocessing from the raw data.\n\nThe Climate Data Store provides access to the GRUAN data version 2 (V2). Currently, only two GRUAN data products (GDP), for Vaisala RS92 and for Meisei RS-11G sondes, are available. In due time (expected early 2021) GRUAN data products for the new Vaisala RS41 sondes will be added. Specific GRUAN data products for other sonde types are also under development. The current dataset provides radiosoundings from 17 stations.\n\nThe GRUAN dataset provides the vertical aggregation of 12 quantities as listed below in the main-variables table. Attributes are described in the related-variables tables. Radiosoundings can be downloaded as comma-separated values (CSV) files organised in two different ways:\n\nCSV one row per level: for each observed height all variables are provided as individual columns in one row.

The blended time series from the station network of the European Climate Assessment & Dataset (ECA&D) project form the basis for the E-OBS gridded dataset. All station data are sourced directly from the European National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) or other data holding institutions. For a considerable number of countries the number of stations used is the complete national network and therefore much more dense than the station network that is routinely shared among NMHSs (which is the basis of other gridded datasets). The density of stations gradually increases through collaborations with NMHSs within European research contracts.\n\nInitially, in 2008, this gridded dataset was developed to provide validation for the suite of Europe-wide climate model simulations produced as part of the European Union ENSEMBLES project. While E-OBS remains an important dataset for model validation, it is also used more generally for monitoring the climate across Europe, particularly with regard to the assessment of the magnitude and frequency of daily extremes.\n\nThe position of E-OBS is unique in Europe because of the relatively high spatial horizontal grid spacing, the daily resolution of the dataset, the provision of multiple variables and the length of the dataset. Finally, the station data on which E-OBS is based are available through the ECA&D webpages (where the owner of the data has given permission to do so). In these respects it contrasts with other datasets.\n\nThe dataset is daily, meaning the observations cover 24 hours per time step. The exact 24-hour period can be different per region. The reason for this is that some data providers measure between midnight to midnight while others might measure from morning to morning. Since E-OBS is an observational dataset, no attempts have been made to adjust time series for this 24-hour offset. It is made sure, where known, that the largest part of the measured 24-hour period corresponds to the day attached to the time step in E-OBS (and ECA&D).\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tRegular latitude-longitude grid\nHorizontal coverage\tEurope\nHorizontal resolution\t0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0 and 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0\nVertical coverage\tNear surface\nVertical resolution\tSingle level\nTemporal coverage\tJanuary 1950 to present\nTemporal resolution\tDay\nFile format\tNetCDF-4\nConventions\tClimate and Forecast Metadata Convention v1.4 (CF-v1.4)\nVersions\tv19.0e, v20.0e, v21.0e and the latest version v22.0e\nUpdate frequency\tNew versions added every 6 months\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nLand surface elevation\tm\tEarth's surface height above sea level derived from the Global 30 Arc-Second Elevation Data Set (GTOPO30) developed by the United States Geological Survey.\nMaximum temperature\t\u00b0C\tDaily maximum air temperature measured near the surface, usually at height of 2 meters.\nMean temperature\t\u00b0C\tDaily mean air temperature measured near the surface, usually at height of 2 meters.\nMinimum temperature\t\u00b0C\tDaily minimum air temperature measured near the surface, usually at height of 2 meters.\nPrecipitation amount\tmm\tTotal daily amount of rain, snow and hail measured as the height of the equivalent liquid water in a square meter The data sources for the precipitation are rain gauge data which do not have a uniform way of defining the 24-hour period over which precipitation measurements are made.

The reforecasts are initialised on the first of each month with a lead time of 215 days at 24-hour time steps. The forcing meteorological data are seasonal reforecasts from the European Centre of Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), consisting of 25 ensemble members up until December 2016, and after that 51 members. Hydrometeorological reforecasts are available from 1991-01-01 up until 2020-10-01.\n\nCompanion datasets, also available through the Climate Data Store (CDS), are seasonal forecasts, for which the seasonal reforecasts can be useful for local skill assessment and post-processing of the seasonal forecasts. For users looking for shorter time ranges there are medium-range forecasts and reforecasts, as well as historical simulations which can be used to derive the hydrological climatology. For users looking for global hydrological data, we refer to the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) forecasts and historical simulations.

Glacier changes are recognized as independent and high-confidence natural indicators of climate change. Past, current and future glacier changes affect global sea level, the regional water cycle and local hazards.\n\nThis product consists of two data sets providing time series of glacier changes: 1. The glacier elevation change series, and 2. the glacier mass balance series. These data sets are an extract of the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) Fluctuations of Glaciers database.\n\nBoth data layers are provided as ESRI shapefiles containing the location of each glacier label point in geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude in degrees) in the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) datum and some general statistical information about each glacier. Both shapefiles come with one ancillary .csv file containing the individual glacier change series linked to the corresponding point shapefile through the World Glacier Monitoring Service identification number (WGMS ID).\n\nThe mass balance series consist of usually continuous annual balance measurements. The elevation change series consist of multi-annual changes with sometimes overlapping survey periods.

The term \"single levels\" is used to express that the variables are 2D-matrices computed on one vertical level which can be surface (or a level close to the surface) or a dedicated pressure level in the atmosphere. Multiple vertical levels are excluded from this catalogue entry.\n\nHigh-resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs) can provide climate change information on regional and local scales in relatively fine detail, which cannot be obtained from coarse scale Global Climate Models (GCMs). This is manifested in better description of small-scale regional climate characteristics and also in more accurate representation of extreme events. Consequently, outputs of such RCMs are indispensable in supporting regional and local climate impact studies and adaptation decisions. RCMs are not independent from the GCMs, since the GCMs provide lateral and lower boundary conditions to the regional models. In that sense RCMs can be viewed as magnifying glasses of the GCMs.\n\nThe CORDEX experiments consist of RCM simulations representing different future socio-economic scenarios (forcings), different combinations of GCMs and RCMs and different ensemble members of the same GCM-RCM combinations. This experiment design through the ensemble members allows for studies addressing questions related to the key uncertainties in future climate change. These uncertainties come from differences in the scenarios of future socio-economic development, the imperfection of regional and global models used and the internal (natural) variability of the climate system. This experiment design allows for studies addressing questions related to the key uncertainties in future climate change:\n\nwhat will future climate forcing be?\nwhat will be the response of the climate system to changes in forcing?\nwhat is the uncertainty related to natural variability of the climate system?\n\nThe term \"experiment\" in the CDS form refers to three main categories:\n\nEvaluation: CORDEX experiment driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis for a past period. These experiments can be used to evaluate the quality of the RCMs using perfect boundary conditions as provided by a reanalysis system. The period covered is typically 1980-2010;\nHistorical: CORDEX experiment which covers a period for which modern climate observations exist. Boundary conditions are provided by GCMs. These experiments, that follow the observed changes in climate forcing, show how the RCMs perform for the past climate when forced by GCMs and can be used as a reference period for comparison with scenario runs for the future. The period covered is typically 1950-2005;\nScenario: Ensemble of CORDEX climate projection experiments using RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) forcing scenarios. These scenarios are the RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios providing different pathways of the future climate forcing. Boundary conditions are provided by GCMs. The period covered is typically 2006-2100.\n\nIn CORDEX, the same experiments were done using different RCMs (labelled as \u201cRegional Climate Model\u201d in the CDS form).\n\nIn addition, for each RCM, there is a variety of GCMs, which can be used as lateral boundary conditions. The GCMs used are coming from the CMIP5 (5th phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) archive. These GCM boundary conditions are labelled as \u201cGlobal Climate Model\u201d in the form and are also available in the CDS.\n\nAdditionally, the uncertainty related to internal variability of the climate system is sampled by running several simulations with the same RCM-GCM combination. On the forms, these are indexed as separate ensemble members (the naming convention for ensemble members is available in the documentation). For each GCM, the same experiment was repeatedly done using slightly different conditions (like initial conditions or different physical parameterisations for instance) producing in that way an ensemble of experiments closely related. More details behind these sequential ensemble numbers is available in the detailed documentation.\n\nThe data are produced by the institutes and modelling centres participating in the different CORDEX domains with partial support from different international and national contributions including support from COPERNICUS for some of the EURO-CORDEX runs.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tProjection differs across the RCMs\nHorizontal coverage\tFrom 27\u00b0N to 72\u00b0N and from 22\u00b0W to 45\u00b0E\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\n0.11\u00b0 x 0.11\u00b0 for the European domain\n\n0.22\u00b0 x 0.22\u00b0 and 0.44\u00b0 x 0.44\u00b0 for the North American domain\n\n\nVertical resolution\tVariables are provided at a specific single level for each variable.

Essential climate variables are generated with the UERRA-HARMONIE and the MESCAN-SURFEX systems. UERRA-HARMONIE is a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation system, while MESCAN-SURFEX is a complementary surface analysis system. Using the Optimal Interpolation method, MESCAN provides the best estimate of daily accumulated precipitation and six-hourly air temperature and relative humidity at 2 meters above the model topography.\n\nThe land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields from UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses. It is run offline, i.e. without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE data assimilation cycles. Using SURFEX offline allows taking full benefit of precipitation analysis and to use the more advanced physics options to better represent surface variables such as surface temperature and surface fluxes, and soil processes related to water and heat transfer in the soil and snow.\n\nIn general, reanalysis combines model data with observations into a complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (6 hours in the UERRA-HARMONIE system) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nThe assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of estimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with.\n\nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates. UERRA-HARMONIE data is available from 1961 and is updated once a month with a delay to real-time of about 4 months. The system provides four analyses per day \u2013 at 0 UTC, 6 UTC, 12 UTC, and 18 UTC. Between the analyses, forecasts of the system are available with hourly resolution. Hence, estimates of the status of the atmosphere are available for every hour since 1961. Moreover, forecasts up to 30 hours are available from the analyses initialised at 0 UTC and 12 UTC.\n\nIn addition to observations in the model domain, a regional reanalysis needs information at its lateral boundaries. For the UERRA-HARMONIE system, this information is taken from the global reanalyses ERA40 (until the end of 1978) and ERA-interim (from 1979). The improvement over global products comes with the higher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details, e.g. topography. Moreover, it enables the system even to consider more observations at places with dense observation networks. The UERRA-HARMONIE regional reanalysis is produced at a horizontal resolution of 11km and MESCAN SURFEX provides data at a resolution of 5.5km.\n\nFor the UERRA-HARMONIE system, variables are produced at the surface and on model levels (65 levels) but are also interpolated to two other level types: pressure levels (24 levels between 1000-10hPa), and height levels (11 levels between 15m-500m). The output of height levels were introduced with special focus on the wind energy sector and their needs. Soil data is available on 14 levels from the surface to a depth of 12m. The number of available parameters varies between the different level types.\n\nIn order to make data access more manageable, the UERRA-HARMONIE and MESCAN-SURFEX dataset has been split into four records. Analysis time steps are available via the CDS whereas forecasts are available only through CDSAPI.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\t\n\nLambert conformal conic grid with 565 x 565 grid points for the UERRA-HARMONIE system.\n\nLambert conformal conic grid with 1069 x 1069 grid points for the MESCAN-SURFEX system.\n\n\nHorizontal coverage\t\n\nEurope:\n\nThe domain spans from northern Africa beyond the northern tip of Scandinavia.\n\nIn the west it ranges far into the Atlantic ocean and in the east it reaches to the Ural.\n\n\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\n11km x 11km for the UERRA-HARMONIE system.\n\n5.5km x 5.5km for the MESCAN-SURFEX system.\n\n\nVertical coverage\t\n\nNear surface for single level variables.\n\nFrom 15m to 500m for height levels variables.\n\nFrom 1000 hPa to 10 hPa for pressure level variables.\n\nFrom the surface to a depth of 12m for the MESCAN-SURFEX system.\n\nFor the UERRA-HARMONIE system the vertical soil coordinates have no precise depth values.

Carbon dioxide is a naturally occurring Greenhouse Gas (GHG), but one whose abundance has been increased substantially above its pre-industrial value of some 280 ppm by human activities, primarily because of emissions from combustion of fossil fuels, deforestation and other land-use change. The annual cycle (especially in the northern hemisphere) is primarily due to seasonal uptake and release of atmospheric CO2 by terrestrial vegetation.\n\nAtmospheric carbon dioxide abundance is indirectly observed by various satellite instruments. These instruments measure spectrally resolved near-infrared and/or infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from carbon dioxide and other constituent gasses can be identified. It is through analysis of those absorption lines in these radiance observations that the averaged carbon dioxide abundance in the sampled atmospheric column can be determined.\n\nThe software used to analyse the absorption lines and determine the carbon dioxide concentration in the sampled atmospheric column is referred to as the retrieval algorithm. For this dataset, carbon dioxide abundances have been determined by applying several algorithms to different satellite instruments. Typically, different algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses and therefore, which product to use for a given application typically depends on the application.\n\nThe data set consists of 2 types of products: (i) column-averaged mixing ratios of CO2, denoted XCO2 and (ii) mid-tropospheric CO2 columns. The XCO2 products have been retrieved from SCIAMACHY/ENVISAT, TANSO-FTS/GOSAT and OCO-2. The mid-tropospheric CO2 product has been retrieved from the IASI instruments on-board the Metop satellite series and from AIRS.\n\nThe XCO2 products are available as Level 2 (L2) products (satellite orbit tracks) and as Level 3 (L3) product (gridded). The L2 products are available as individual sensor products (SCIAMACHY: BESD and WFMD algorithms; GOSAT: OCFP and SRFP algorithms) and as a multi-sensor merged product (EMMA algorithm). The L3 XCO2 product is provided in OBS4MIPS format. The IASI and AIRS products are available as L2 products generated with the NLIS algorithm.\n\nThis data set is updated on a yearly basis, with each update cycle adding (if required) a new data version for the entire period, up to one year behind real time.\n\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of C3S with the exception of the SCIAMACHY and AIRS L2 products that were generated in the framework of the GHG-CCI project of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI).\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\t\n\nLevel 2 (L2): Along satellite orbit tracks\n\nLevel 3 (L3): Gridded\n\n\nProjection\tRegular latitude-longitude grid\nHorizontal coverage\tBetween approximately 70\u00b0N and 70\u00b0S\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\nSCIAMACHY (L2): 30x60 km2\n\nTANSO (L2): 10 km (diameter)\n\nIASI (L2): 12 km (diameter)\n\nL3 products: 5\u00b0 x 5\u00b0\n\n\nVertical coverage\t\n\nSCIAMACHY, TANSO and L3 products: Total atmospheric column\n\nAIRS and IASI: Mid-troposphere\n\n\nVertical resolution\tSingle layer\nTemporal coverage\t\n\nSCIAMACHY (L2): October 2002 until April 2012\n\nIASI (L2): July 2007 until December 2017\n\nTANSO (L2): April 2009 until December 2018\n\nL3 products: August 2003 until March 2018\n\n\nTemporal resolution\t\n\nL3 products: Monthly\n\nL2 products are provided as observation footprints along satellite orbits at the sampling frequency of the sensor.

Forecasts up to 30 hours initialised from the analyses at 00 and 12 UTC are available only through the CDS-API (see Documentation).\n\nUERRA-HARMONIE is a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation system, while MESCAN-SURFEX is a complementary surface analysis system. Using the Optimal Interpolation method, MESCAN provides the best estimate of daily accumulated precipitation and six-hourly air temperature and relative humidity at 2 meters above the model topography.\n\nThe land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields from UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses. It is run offline, i.e. without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE data assimilation cycles. Using SURFEX offline allows to take full benefit of precipitation analysis and to use the more advanced physics options to better represent surface variables such as surface temperature and surface fluxes, and soil processes related to water and heat transfer in the soil and snow.\n\nIn general, the assimilation systems are able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of estimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with. The observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the much sparser observational networks, e.g. in 1960s, will have an impact on the quality of analyses leading to less accurate estimates. The improvement over global reanalysis products comes with the higher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details (e.g. topography). Moreover, it enables the system even to use more observations at places with dense observation networks.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\t\n\nLambert conformal conic grid with 565 x 565 grid points for the UERRA-HARMONIE system.\n\nLambert conformal conic grid with 1069 x 1069 grid points for the MESCAN-SURFEX system.\n\n\nHorizontal coverage\t\n\nEurope:\n\nThe domain spans from northern Africa beyond the northern tip of Scandinavia.\n\nIn the west it ranges far into the Atlantic ocean and in the east it reaches to the Ural.\n\n\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\n11km x 11km for the UERRA-HARMONIE system.\n\n5.5km x 5.5km for the MESCAN-SURFEX system.\n\n\nVertical coverage\tNear surface.\nVertical resolution\tSingle level.\nTemporal coverage\tJanuary 1961 to July 2019.\nTemporal resolution\tAnalysis are availabe each day at 00, 06, 12 and 18 UTC.\nFile format\tGRIB2\nUpdate frequency\tNo expected updates.\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\n10m wind direction\tDegrees\tWind direction valid for a grid cell at the height of 10m above the surface.

The BA is identified with the date of first detection of the burned signal in the case of the pixel product, and with the total BA per grid cell in the case of the grid product. The products were obtained through the analysis of reflectance changes from medium resolution sensors (Terra MODIS, Sentinel-3 OLCI), supported by the use of MODIS thermal information. The burned area products also include information related to the land cover that has been burned, which has been extracted from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) land cover dataset, thus assuring consistency between the datasets.\n\nThe algorithms for BA retrieval were developed by the University of Alcala (Spain), and processed by Brockmann Consult GmbH (Germany).

FireCCI v5.0cds and FireCCI v5.1cds were developed as part of the Fire ECV Climate Change Initiative Project (Fire CCI) and brokered to C3S, offering the first global burned area time series at 250m spatial resolution. FireCCI v5.1cds used a more mature algorithm than the previous version. This algorithm was adapted to Sentinel-3 OLCI data to create the C3S v1.0 burned area product, extending the BA database to the present.\n\nDuring July 2020, an error in some files in the version v5.1cds were identified, affecting the files of the grid product of January 2018, and the pixel and grid products of October, November and December 2019. These errors were fixed, and a new version, v5.1.1cds, was created for the whole time series, to replace version v5.1cds. The latter product has been deprecated, but it is temporally kept in the database for transparency and traceability reasons. Only version v5.1.1cds should be used.\n\nThe BA products are useful for researchers studying climate change, as they provide crucial information on burned biomass, which can be translated to greenhouse gases emissions amongst other contaminants.

In general, the assimilation systems are able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The laws of physics allow for estimates at locations where data coverage is low. The provision of estimates at each grid point in Europe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with.\n\nThe land surface platform SURFEX is forced with downscaled forecast fields from UERRA-HARMONIE as well as MESCAN analyses. It is run offline, i.e. without feedback to the atmospheric analysis performed in MESCAN or the UERRA-HARMONIE data assimilation cycles.\n\nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will have an impact on the quality of analyses leading to less accurate estimates. The improvement over global reanalysis products comes with the higher horizontal resolution that allows incorporating more regional details (e.g. topography). Moreover, it enables the system even to use more observations at places with dense observation networks.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\t\n\nLambert conformal conic grid with 565 x 565 grid points for the UERRA-HARMONIE system.\n\nLambert conformal conic grid with 1069 x 1069 grid points for the MESCAN-SURFEX system.\n\n\nHorizontal coverage\t\n\nEurope:\n\nThe domain spans from northern Africa beyond the northern tip of Scandinavia.\n\nIn the west it ranges far into the Atlantic ocean and in the east it reaches to the Ural.\n\n\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\n11km x 11km for the UERRA-HARMONIE system.\n\n5.5km x 5.5km for the MESCAN-SURFEX system.\n\n\nVertical coverage\t\n\nFrom the surface to a depth of 12m for the MESCAN-SURFEX system.\n\nFor the UERRA-HARMONIE system the vertical coordinates have no precise depth values.

The FAPAR value results directly from the radiative transfer in the canopy which is instantaneous. It depends on canopy structure, vegetation element optical properties and illumination conditions. FAPAR is very useful as input to a number of primary productivity models based on simple efficiency considerations. FAPAR is relatively linearly related to reflectance values and is little sensitive to scaling issues. Note also that the FAPAR refers only to the green parts of the canopy.\n\nLeaf area Index: LAI is defined as half the developed area of photosynthetically active elements of the vegetation per unit horizontal ground area. It determines the size of the interface for exchange of energy (including radiation) and mass between the canopy and the atmosphere. This is an intrinsic canopy primary variable that should not depend on observation conditions. LAI is strongly non-linearly related to reflectance. Therefore, its estimation from remote sensing observations is scale dependent. Note that vegetation LAI as estimated from remote sensing includes all the green contributors such as the understory when existing under forests canopies. However, except when using directional observations, LAI is not directly accessible from remote sensing observations due to the possible heterogeneity in leaf distribution within the canopy volume. Therefore, remote sensing observations are rather sensitive to the \u2018effective\u2019 leaf area index, i.e. the value that provides the same diffuse gap fraction while assuming a random distribution of leaves. The difference between the actual LAI and the effective LAI may be quantified by the clumping index that roughly varies between 0.5 (very clumped canopies) and 1.0 (randomly distributed leaves). Note that similarly to the other variables, the retrieved LAI is mainly corresponding to the green elements: the correct term to be used would be GAI (Green Area Index) although we propose to still use LAI for the sake of simplicity.\n\nDifferent product versions are available. LAI and FAPAR version v0 are a brokered dataset from the Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS) while version v1 and v2 are produced by the C3S service.\n\nVersion v1.0: The theoretical framework for the CDR LAI and FAPAR algorithm version v1.0 capitalizes on the past experience gained in the Copernicus Global Land products (Baret et al. 2013). It capitalizes itself on the development and validation of already existing products: CYCLOPES Version 3.1 and MODIS Collection 5, and the use of neural networks. Verger et al. (2008) demonstrated that this approach could be used efficiently to estimate LAI and FAPAR from existing products provided that a strong link exists between the inputs and the outputs in the training dataset. Error propagation was included in the version v1.0 (compared to v0.0).\n\nVersion v2.0: The version v2.0 of LAI and FAPAR are retrieved by applying the Two-stream Inversion Package (TIP) to visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) broadband albedos. TIP is based on the Two-stream Model developed by Pinty et al. 2006, which implements the two-stream approximation of radiative transfer for a homogeneous canopy (\u201c1D-canopy\u201d).\n\nPlease note that LAI version v0.0 and v1.0 represent the actual LAI while version v2.0 produced by the TIP (Two Inversion Package) model represents the \"effective\" LAI.

The maximum value is never witnessed in practice because some of the incoming light is always reflected back by the canopy or the underlying ground.\nLeaf Area Index (LAI)\tDimensionless\tLeaf Area Index of a plant canopy or ecosystem, is defined as one half of the total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area. It measures the area of leaf material present in the specified environment. This dimensionless variable (sometimes expressed in terms of square metres of leaf material per square metre of ground) varies between 0 and values of about 10 or so, depending on local conditions.\n\nRELATED VARIABLES\nAlong with the main variables the following variables are included in V0 and V1:\n- Error uncertainty on every band in the variable;\n- QFLAG: the quality flag of the product;\n- NMOD: the number of valid observations during the 20-day synthesis period that are used to calculate.\n\nIn V2 the following variables are included:\n- Error: uncertainty on every band in the variable;\n- In FAPAR product: unc_correl: uncertainty correlation is the correlation of LAI_ERR and fAPAR _ERR.

Ozone is naturally formed in the atmosphere through the interaction between molecular oxygen and solar radiation. In the stratosphere, it acts as a shield protecting us from the UV radiation emitted by the Sun. At ground level however, it is a human health irritant and a component of smog. Ozone and climate change are strongly related.\n\nThe ozone abundance in the atmosphere can be measured from space using a number of different remote-sensing techniques relying on ozone absorption at UV, visible, infrared and millimeter wavelengths. Instruments use the solar light or the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth to derive the vertical distribution of ozone in nadir, limb and solar occultation observation geometries. In the measured signal, molecular absorption features characteristic of ozone are detected using appropriate retrieval algorithms and are used to quantify its abundance.\n\nThe dataset is organised in four main products:\n\nOzone total columns from UV nadir sensors;\nOzone total and tropospheric columns from thermal infrared nadir sensors;\nOzone profile retrieval from UV-nadir sensors;\nOzone profile retrieval from limb and occultation sensors.\n\nData are available as Level-3 and/or Level-4 data products. Level-3 data correspond to measurements provided on a regular latitude/longitude after re-gridding of level-2 data (satellite orbit tracks) and averaging in time (over a month). Level-4 products are generated from Level-2 data after assimilation in a three-dimensional chemistry-transport model.\n\nWe distinguish between Climate Data Record (CDR) and intermediate-CDR (ICDR). For ozone datasets distributed here, both ICDR and CDR products are generated using common software and algorithms. The CDRs cover past time periods and include the sensors that are no longer in operation. They are meant to have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to detect climate variability and change. The ICDRs are generated by satellite instruments still in operation, and are therefore regularly updated. Recent ICDR data are provided with a short-delay.

The surface elevation change is modelled over successive, overlapping periods and reported monthly. The dataset production method is an evolution of those employed by the European Space Agency (ESA)'s Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheet Climate Change Initiatives and is guided by the Global Climate Observing System targets for the Ice Sheets Essential Climate Variable.\n\nAn annual Climate Data Record (CDR), and monthly intermediate CDRs (ICDRs) are issued.

Methane is a naturally occurring Greenhouse Gas (GHG), but one whose abundance has been increased substantially above its pre-industrial value of some 720 ppb by human activities, primarily because of agricultural emissions (e.g., rice production, ruminants) and fossil fuel production and use. A clear annual cycle is largely due to seasonal wetland emissions.\n\nAtmospheric methane abundance is indirectly observed by various satellite instruments. These instruments measure spectrally resolved near-infrared and infrared radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth and its atmosphere. In the measured signal, molecular absorption signatures from methane and constituent gasses can be identified. It is through analysis of those absorption lines in these radiance observations that the averaged methane abundance in the sampled atmospheric column can be determined.\n\nThe software used to analyse the absorption lines and determine the methane concentration in the sampled atmospheric column is referred to as the retrieval algorithm.

With this technique, the Lake Water Level is defined as the height, in meters above the geoid (the shape that the surface would take under the influence of the gravity and rotation of Earth) of the reflecting surface. It is observed by space radar altimeters that measure the time it takes for radar pulses to reach the ground targets, directly below the spacecraft (nadir position), and return. Hence, only lakes located along the satellite's ground tracks can be monitored, with a quality of measurement that not only depends of the size of the lake, but also on the reflecting targets in its surroundings such as topography or vegetation. For each of the key lakes monitored in the C3S Lakes production system, the Level-3 Water Level is provided in separate file along with the corresponding uncertainty.\n\nThis altimetric technique, that can complement ground-based observations systems, potentially provides a major improvement in the field of continental hydrology, due to the global coverage (however limited to Earth\u2019s portion at nadir of the orbital ground tracks), regular temporal sampling and short delivery delays.\n\nThe Lake Water Level is a recognized Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Lake Water Level products are generated by CLS on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Services, the Earth Observation Programme of the European Commission.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tPoint data\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal (94 lakes on 4 continents)\nHorizontal resolution\tOne value per lake per timestep\nVertical coverage\tSingle level\nVertical resolution\tSurface\nTemporal coverage\t1992 to present\nTemporal resolution\tBetween 1 to 10 days\nFile format\tNetCDF-4\nConventions\tClimate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.7, Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) v1.3\nVersions\t2.1\nUpdate frequency\tAnnually\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nWater surface height\tm\tThe height of the water surface with respect to geoid (the shape that the surface would take under the influence of the gravity and rotation of Earth) of the inland water body.\nWater surface height uncertainty\tm\tThe uncertainty attributed to the water surface height for each time step." ], "Parameters": [ "Water surface height", "Water surface height uncertainty" ] }

These two products are part of the broader discipline of ocean colour remote sensing, which analyses ocean surface radiances measured from space to derive information about the optical properties and constituents of the upper ocean. This information plays an essential role in our ability to monitor the health and productivity of marine ecosystems, assess the role of the oceans in the global carbon cycle, and quantify the impacts of climate change. Satellite remote sensing is the only method for regular monitoring of the ocean biology on a global scale.\n\nRemote-sensing reflectance (or Rrs) is defined as the ratio of water-leaving radiance to downwelling irradiance and serves as the main input to algorithms used to derive other ocean colour products. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is the main photosynthetic pigment found in phytoplankton, which form the base of the marine food-web and are responsible for approximately half of global photosynthesis. Chl-a can be estimated from Rrs data using different algorithms (see details in the Documentation). Here, we provide a blended Chl-a estimate from multiple algorithms, where blending is based on the suitability of each candidate algorithm to the optical typology of a given pixel. This approach provides the best estimates of global Chl-a across a range of water types.\n\nThe files from this dataset contain global daily composites of merged sensor products: SeaWiFS, MERIS, MODIS Aqua, VIIRS, and (from version 5.0 onward) OLCI. Note that Rrs and Chl-a data are only available over cloud- and ice-free areas. As a result, more complete spatial coverage (as shown in the map in the upper-right corner) can be achieved by aggregating data over longer time periods.\n\nThis dataset is produced using the processing chain software developed by the Ocean Colour component of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative project (ESA OC-CCI).

Sea ice is an important component of our climate system and a sensitive indicator of climate change. Its presence or its retreat has a strong impact on air-sea interactions, the Earth\u2019s energy budget as well as marine ecosystems. It is recognized by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable. Sea ice thickness is one of the parameters commonly used to characterise sea ice, alongside sea ice concentration, sea ice edge, and sea ice type, also available in the Climate Data Store.\n\nSatellite radar altimeters provide measurements of the sea ice freeboard, which is the difference between the height of the surface of sea ice and the surface of water in open leads (areas of open water within the sea ice). Because of the buoyancy of ice in water, typically about 90% of the ice thickness remains under water and thus the total ice thickness is about 10 times the freeboard. However, snow on top of sea ice changes this ratio and complicates the estimation of the ice thickness, requiring the use of auxiliary information about snow depth and density. The retrieval of ice thickness uses the narrow radar swath at the nadir of the satellite at full resolution of approximately 1-10 km and a point spacing of 300 meters. This Level-2 sea-ice thickness products (not provided here) is then gridded for a period of a month to obtain full coverage of a north polar grid at a resolution of 25 km. The algorithm used was developed as part of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) on Sea Ice.\n\nThe data provided here are Level-3 Collated (L3C) products: they contain monthly gridded values from orbit data from a single platform (Envisat or CryoSat-2) without interpolation or any other form of gap filling. The files also contain estimates of the algorithm uncertainty as well as a quality status flag indicating potential issues with the retrieval not captured in the algorithm uncertainty. Sources of uncertainty in the algorithm are related to the auxiliary data and to the use of different radar altimeter concepts in Envisat (pulse-limited) and CryoSat-2 (synthetic aperture radar).\n\nThis dataset combines a Climate Data Record (CDR), which has sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to be used to assess climate variability and change, and an Interim Climate Data Record (ICDR), which provides regular temporal extensions to the CDR and where consistency with the CDR is expected but not extensively checked. Here, the CDR is based on measurements from the RA-2 altimeter on Envisat (October 2002 to October 2010) and the SIRAL altimeter on CryoSat-2 (November 2010 to March 2015). The ICDR is based on observations from CryoSat-2 only (from April 2015 onward) and is updated monthly with a one-month delay behind real time.\n\nThis dataset is currently limited spatially to the Arctic region and temporally to the winter months of October through April due to unresolved bias originating from melting snow or open melt ponds in the remaining five months. For a similar reason, no sea-ice thickness data with sufficient quality exist for the Southern Hemisphere. The extension of the CDR/ICDR to other periods, regions, and radar altimeter missions is under development in the extension of the ESA CCI Sea Ice project (ESA CCI+) and a new dataset version is expected for 2021.\n\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S).\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tLambert Azimuthal Equal Area (EASE-Grid verion 2.0) centred over the North Pole\nHorizontal coverage\tNorthern Hemisphere\nHorizontal resolution\t25 km grid resolution (true spatial resolution: 1-10 km)\nVertical coverage\tSurface\nVertical resolution\tSingle level\nTemporal coverage\tOctober 2002 to present, only for Northern Hemisphere winter months (October through April)\nTemporal resolution\tMonthly (with a 1-month latency)\nFile format\tNetCDF 4\nConventions\tClimate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.6, Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) v1.3\nVersions\tv1.0 (new version expected in 2021)\nUpdate frequency\tMonthly (with a 1-month latency)\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nSea ice thickness\tm\tMean thickness of the sea ice layer in the area of the grid cell covered by ice.\n\nRELATED VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nQuality flag\tDimensionless\tQuality flag for the sea ice thickness retrievals.

The rise in global mean sea level in recent decades has been one of the most important and well-known consequences of climate warming, putting a large fraction of the world population and economic infrastructure at greater risk of flooding. However, changes in the global average sea level mask regional variations that can be one order of magnitude larger. Therefore, it is essential to measure changes in sea level over the world\u2019s oceans as accurately as possible.\n\nSea level anomaly is defined as the height of water over the mean sea surface in a given time and region. In this dataset sea level anomalies are computed with respect to a twenty-year mean reference period (1993-2012) using up-to-date altimeter standards.\n\nIn the past, the altimeter sea level datasets were distributed on the CNES AVISO altimetry portal until their production was taken over by the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) in 2015 and 2016 respectively.\n\nThe sea level data set provided here by C3S is climate-oriented, that is, dedicated to the monitoring of the long-term evolution of sea level and the analysis of the ocean/climate indicators, both requiring a homogeneous and stable sea level record. To achieve this, a steady two-satellite merged constellation is used at all time steps in the production system: one satellite serves as reference and ensures the long-term stability of the data record; the other satellite (which varies across the record) is used to improve accuracy, sample mesoscale processes and provide coverage at high latitudes. The C3S sea level data set is used to produce Ocean Monitoring Indicators (e.g. global and regional mean sea level evolution), available in the CMEMS catalogue.\n\nThe CMEMS sea level dataset has a more operational focus as it is dedicated to the retrieval of mesoscale signals in the context of ocean modeling and analysis of the ocean circulation on a global or regional scale. Such applications require the most accurate sea level estimates at each time step with the best spatial sampling of the ocean with all satellites available, with less emphasis on long-term stability and homogeneity.\n\nThis data set is updated three times a year with a delay of about 6 months relative to present time. This delay is mainly due to the timeliness of the input data, the centred processing temporal window and the validation process. However, these processing and validation steps are essential to enhance the stability and accuracy of the sea level products and make them suitable for climate applications.\n\nThis dataset includes estimates of sea level anomaly and absolute dynamic topography together with the corresponding geostrophic velocities.

It is based on the ESA Climate Change Initiative soil moisture version 03.3 and represents the current state-of-the-art for satellite-based soil moisture climate data record production, in line with the \u201cSystematic observation requirements for satellite-based products for climate\u201d as defined by GCOS (Global Climate Observing System). Data are on a regular latitude/longitude grid expectedly with gaps in space and time.\n\nWhen dealing with satellite data it is common to encounter references to Climate Data Records (CDR) and interim-CDR (ICDR). For this dataset, both the ICDR and CDR parts of each product were generated using the same software and algorithms. The CDR is intended to have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to detect climate variability and change. The ICDR provides a short-delay access to current data where consistency with the CDR baseline is expected but was not extensively checked. The dataset contains the following products: \"active\", \"passive\" and \"combined\". The \"active\" and \"passive\" products were created by using scatterometer and radiometer soil moisture products, respectively. The \"combined\" product results from a blend based on the two previous products.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tRegular latitude-longitude grid\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\t0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0\nTemporal coverage\t1978 to present\nTemporal resolution\tDay, 10-day and month\nFile format\tNetCDF\nUpdate frequency\tDepends on the product: 10-day for the ICDR and 6 month for the CDR.\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nSurface soil moisture\t%\tContent of liquid water in a surface soil layer of 2 to 5 cm depth expressed as the percentage of total saturation.\nVolumetric soil moisture\tm3 m-3\tContent of liquid water in a surface soil layer of 2 to 5 cm depth expressed as m3 water per m3 soil." ], "Parameters": [ "Surface soil moisture", "Volumetric soil moisture" ] }

{ "Webpage": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-surface-radiation-budget", "Title": "Surface radiation budget from 1982 to present derived from satellite observations", "Description": [ "This dataset provides the Surface Radiation Budget (SRB) Essential Climate Variable (ECV). SRB represents the balance between the heating of the surface through incoming solar radiation and cooling through emission of infra-red radiation which is a fundamental component of the surface energy budget. Small changes in the surface radiation budget can lead to large climatological responses, which makes a permanent and precise monitoring indispensable. Accurate understanding of the surface radiation budget at regional and global scales can improve the understanding of the Earth\u2019s climate system and supports research on current and anticipated climate change, as well as the evaluation of radiative processes in climate models. Better knowledge of the global and regional surface radiation budget is also required for a successful utilization of renewable energy sources, such as solar power plants.\n\nThe ECV Surface Radiation Budget contains seven variables which can be separated into the solar (shortwave) and the thermal (longwave) surface radiation components. Both components include the incoming (downwelling), the outgoing (upwelling), and the net radiation fluxes. These variables were produced by two \u201cproduct families\u201d, based on the data from different sensors and algorithms cover the same seven variables. The two families follow somewhat different nomenclatures. To help the user to navigate the different names, a table relating the names used in the download form with the names used within the files and in other datasets distributed by the Climate Data Store is added at the end of this overview. The fact that the naming is different reflects the fact that each family was originated by different projects within different organisations at different times. However, the third organisation, the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) is not associated with a different product family in this dataset. In fact it is associated with both product families to which it provides a continuation of their production chain. This means that the datasets contains three organisation but just two product families.\n\nThe \u201cCLARA product family\u201d and \u201cCCI product family\u201d provide two complementary Thematic Climate Data Records (TCDRs), differing in temporal and horizontal resolution. These TCDR timeseries are intended to have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to detect climate variability and change. They are frequently updated with Interim Climate Data Records (ICDRs) or simply extensions, generated using the same software and algorithms to cover more recent periods. Further details on algorithms, data description, and extensive validation results are given in the Documentation section.", "\n\n  \n    The \u201cCLARA product family\u201d refers to EUMETSAT\u2019s CM SAF CLARA-A2 data record (CM SAF cLoud, Albedo and surface RAdiation dataset from AVHRR data - Edition 2).\nIt merges the AVHRR-sensor data from a variety of satellites into a combined TCDR of 34 years.\n It includes the daily means of surface downwelling shortwave flux as well as monthly means of surface downwelling shortwave, surface upwelling longwave, and surface downwelling longwave flux.

Agroclimatic indicators are useful in conveying climate variability and change in the terms that are meaningful to the agricultural sector. The objective of this dataset is to provide these indicators at a global scale in an easily accessible and usable format for further downstream analysis and the forcing of agricultural impact models.\n\nERA-interim reanalysis and bias-corrected climate datasets have been used to generate the agroclimatic indicators for historical and future time periods. The input data was provided through the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), of which the ISIMIP Fast Track product was used. This product contains daily, biased-corrected, climate data from 5 CMIP5 General Circulation Models covering the period 1951-2099 (historical run up to 2005). The agroclimatic indicators were also generated using the WFDEI (Watch Forcing Data methodology applied to ERA-Interim) for the 1981-2010 climatological period. A total of 26 indicators are provided in this dataset at a spatial resolution of 0.5\u00b0x0.5\u00b0 on a lat-lon grid. The temporal resolution of the variables differs depending on the indicator - they are available at 10 consecutive days (10-day), seasonal or annual resolution.\n\nAgroclimatic indicators are often used in species distribution modelling to study phenological developments of plants under varying climate conditions. For many users in the agricultural community, assessments of crop development for the current or future cropping seasons are particularly important. This is especially true for the agro-policy and the agro-business communities, as early indications of production anomalies are of paramount importance for tax/subsidies and price volatility. The provision of pre-computed agroclimatic indicators make them readily available to the user and will facilitate the use of climate data by the agricultural community.\n\nThe data was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tRegular latitude-longitude grid\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\t0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0\nVertical coverage\tSurface\nVertical resolution\tSingle level\nTemporal coverage\t1951 to 2099\nTemporal resolution\tVariable dependent: 10-day, seasonal or annual\nFile format\tNetCDF-4\nConventions\tClimate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.7\nUpdate frequency\tNo updates expected\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nBiologically effective degree days\t\u00b0C\tSum of daily mean temperatures (TG) above 10\u00b0C and less than 30\u00b0C, over 10 days.\nCold spell duration index\tday\tNumber of days per season with at least 6 consecutive days when TN < TN10th, where TN is the daily minimum temperature and TN10th is the calendar day 10th percentile.

Eutrophication refers to the excessive nutrient input into water bodies that lead to increased primary production, algal blooms, and low-oxygenated waters, consequently causing a reduction to marine life and habitat degradation. These indicators are useful to the long-term planning and monitoring of water quality since coastal areas of Europe are subject to the adverse effects of eutrophication, i.e. the increased occurrence of harmful algal blooms.\n\nOcean eutrophication may be determined by measuring the concentration of chlorophyll-a, a measure of the amount of primary production in the water column. This may be modelled using biogeochemical models or observed by its green colour in the ocean using satellite remote sensing. In this dataset, the indicators are derived from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) ocean colour satellite product for 2006-2016 and climate projections. To produce the climate projections, two marine hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models forced with climate simulations were used: the NEMO-ERSEM model run on a domain for the Northwest European Shelf, and the POLCOM-ERSEM model run on a domain covering the Northwest European Shelf and Mediterranean Sea.\n\nThe indicators are based on comparisons between daily chlorophyll-a concentration values and the daily 90th percentile (P90) chlorophyll-a concentration from climatology. The P90 of chlorophyll-a concentration can itself be used to detect abnormal levels of chlorophyll-a concentration in an ecosystem and has been adopted as a measure of eutrophication in coastal waters by the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Northeast Atlantic 2008 (OSPAR). It is considered to be a robust ecological indicator of trophic ecological status. This is developed upon in this dataset and the measure of eutrophication used is the proportion of days in each month which have unusually high chlorophyll values (greater than that day\u2019s climatological P90 value). It has dimensionless units and its expected value in the absence of changes in eutrophication state is 0.1. The main eutrophication indicator in this dataset is the difference between this proportion and 0.1 and is referred to as the chlorophyll-a anomaly indicator. Additional derived indicators are also included that further measure changes in eutrophication status over different periods. For instance, we could ask whether a location has become generally more eutrophic up to August 2000, or whether Augusts have become more eutrophic up to 2000. The algorithms and metrics for eutrophication were developed and applied by Plymouth Marine Laboratory (UK).\n\nIn order to assess the impact of climate change, simulations under two future climate scenarios based on different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) for future greenhouse gas concentration are conducted: the intermediate scenario, RCP4.5, in which greenhouse gas concentration peak around 2040 before declining mainly due to successful mitigation measures in place; and the more pessimistic scenario, RCP8.5, where greenhouse gas concentration continue to rise throughout the century. The hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models were driven by one Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) global climate model (GCM) projection downscaled to a regional climate model (RCM). Note that by using only one of the many possible combinations of GCM-RCM pairs leads to an incomplete estimate of the true uncertainty in the outcome in a changing climate by, most likely, indicating a smaller spread of outcomes than if the estimate were based on a larger ensemble of such GCM-RCM combinations. This does not necessarily mean a reduction in the true uncertainty, but simply an incomplete estimate of it.\n\nThis dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nHorizontal coverage\t\n\nPOLCOMS-ERSEM: Northwest European Shelf and Mediterranean Sea (20W to 37E, 11N to 65N)\n\nNEMO-ERSEM: Northwest European Shelf (20W to 13E, 40N to 65N)\n\nCMEMS satellite product: Northwest European Shelf and Mediterranean Sea (46W to 37E, 11N to 65N)\n\n\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\nPOLCOMS-ERSEM: 0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0 (approx. 11km)\n\nNEMO-ERSEM: 0.06\u00b0 x 0.06\u00b0 (approx. 7km)\n\nCMEMS satellite product: 1km x 1km\n\n\nVertical coverage\tSingle level\nVertical resolution\tVariables are provided on a single level which may differ among variables\nTemporal coverage\t\n\nPOLCOMS-ERSEM: 2006 up to 2100\n\nNEMO-ERSEM: 2006 to 2049\n\nCMEMS satellite product: 2006 \u2013 2016\n\n\nTemporal resolution\tMonthly\nFile format\tNetCDF-4\nConventions\tClimate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.4\nVersions\tv1.0\nUpdate frequency\tNo updates expected\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nChlorophyll-a anomaly\tdimensionless\tThe anomaly is a measure of the extent to which the number of unusually high daily chlorophyll-a values is greater or less than expected. Unusually high is defined as exceeding P90 value for that day. At a given position, if the anomaly is zero and equal to the reference period we would expect the number of times the daily chlorophyll-a value exceeds P90 over a month to be 10% (0.1) of the total number of chlorophyll measurements. The monthly anomaly is therefore the difference between the actual proportion and 0.1, hence has a possible range of -0.1 (proportion=0) to 0.9 (proportion=1). Positive anomaly means we encounter more unusually high chlorophyll values than expected, negative anomaly means we encounter less.\nChlorophyll-a anomaly P-value\tdimensionless\tThe two-tailed P-value of the mean annual rate of change in chlorophyll-a anomaly. Low P-values indicate that the results are unlikely to have arisen by chance, and so we can be more confident that the trend is real. Standard practice is to treat P-values less than 0.05 as significant.\nChlorophyll-a anomaly gradient\tyear-1\tThe mean annual rate of change of the chlorophyll-a anomaly from the start of the time series to the given date, determined through simple linear regression. These data are available either as a 'standard' time series where data is presented with a monthly resolution, progressing January, February etc. through the year, or split out on a calendar month basis where only data for a named month is returned. This monthly data is useful for comparing year on year changes for a specific month or season.\nCumulative chlorophyll-a anomaly\tdimensionless\tThe cumulative sum of monthly anomalies from the start of the time series to the given date. This is a measure of consistent behaviour in the anomaly, e.g. if the anomaly is highly variable but slightly greater than zero on average, this might be hard to detect in the anomaly or slope data, but the cumulative anomaly will gradually increase. This can either be calculated using every month in the time series, or using only the calendar month corresponding to the date, e.g. the sum to August 2016 would use only August anomalies. For the data stored by month this is the cumulative difference between the monthly proportion exceeding climatological P90 and 0.1 in the given calendar month.\nStandard error of the cumulative chlorophyll-a anomaly\tdimensionless\tThis is a measure of the statistical uncertainty of the cumulative anomaly. For instance, a cumulative anomaly of 1 would suggest a consistent anomaly greater than zero if its standard error were 0.1, but would be attributable to chance if it were 10. For the data stored by month this is the standard error of the cumulative difference in proportion in the given calendar month." ], "Parameters": [ "Chlorophyll-a anomaly", "Chlorophyll-a anomaly P-value", "Chlorophyll-a anomaly gradient", "Cumulative chlorophyll-a anomaly", "Standard error of the cumulative chlorophyll-a anomaly" ] }

The SS-DBEM is a mechanistic model, which means that it takes into account aspects of ecology (e.g. habitat preference, migration) and physiology (e.g. growth and reproduction) to determine biomass and distribution of fish species in response to changes in the environment (e.g. temperature, competition with other species, food availability). The SS-DBEM projects the impact of changes in the environment (e.g. warming, deoxygenation) and human activity (fishing pressure) on the abundance and biomass of modelled species. All this makes it a state of the art model in regard to projecting fish distribution and trends in both abundance and catch in response to climate change. Model outputs consist of fish abundance (number of fish per grid cell) and fish catch (number of fish caught per grid cell) considering three different fishing activity scenarios, termed the Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY). Whilst the model units are expressed as \u201cNumber of individuals\u201d, they are not to be used to predict actual future stocks but rather numbers relative to the initial starting values of the model. This is because the model was not intialised with actual fish numbers and subsequently the significance of this dataset is to show temporal and geographical trends, relative to other years and other grid points, in response to changes in the climate and the applied Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY).\n\nIn order to assess the impact of climate change, simulations under two future climate scenarios based on different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) for future greenhouse gas concentrations are conducted: the intermediate scenario, RCP4.5, in which greenhouse gas concentrations peak around 2040 before declining mainly due to successful mitigation measures in place; and the more pessimistic scenario, RCP8.5, where greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise throughout the century. Fishing activity was defined according to the MSY under these environmental conditions. The combination of MSY and RCP scenarios included in this dataset are:\n\nGlobal sustainability: RCP4.5 with a MSY of 0.6 (fish stock is managed globally toward sustainability)\n\nWorld Markets: RCP8.5 with a MSY of 0.8 (fish stock is managed globally to avoid overfishing)\n\nNational Enterprise: RCP8.5 with a MSY of 1.1 (fish stocks are managed at the national level resulting in overfishing)\n\nThe simulations were run using inputs from two marine hydrodynamic-biogeochemical models: the POLCOM-ERSEM and NEMO-ERSEM models.

The dataset has been produced using the marine ecosystem model, ERSEM v15.06 (European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model), coupled to the regional ocean circulation models, POLCOMS (the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory Coastal Ocean Modelling System) and NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) using the FABM (Framework for Aquatic Biogeochemical Models) coupler. ERSEM is designed to simulate the cycles of carbon and the major nutrient elements nitrogen, phosphorous and silicon within the marine environment. Organisms at the base of the marine food web \u2013 the microscopic aquatic plants known as phytoplankton \u2013 play an integral role in these cycles and are explicitly represented in the model. So are the microscopic marine organisms which feed upon them and provide a vital link to commercially exploited species of fish and shell fish higher up the food chain.\n\nPOLCOMS and NEMO are well-established physical models with the ability to simulate regions that include both the deep ocean and the continental shelf. They track the movement of water and transfer of energy and momentum in three dimensions, enabling the water temperature, salinity (the salt content of sea water) and currents to be modelled. The coupled POLCOMS/NEMO-ERSEM system makes it possible to include the effects of physical transport and mixing processes on the spatiotemporal distribution of nutrients, phytoplankton, and other components of the marine ecosystem. The dataset includes physical variables, such as horizontal velocity components, temperature and salinity; and a range of biogeochemical variables, including the concentration of dissolved oxygen and the concentration of different nutrients. These variables were simulated under two future scenarios, based on different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) for future greenhouse gas emissions: the intermediate scenario, RCP4.5, in which greenhouse gas emissions peak around 2040 before declining; and the business as usual scenario, RCP8.5, in which greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise throughout the century. The hydrodynamic biogeochemical models were each driven by a global climate model generated for the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) at the open ocean boundaries, in combination with downscaled atmospheric data generated using the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) Rossby Centre Regional Atmospheric Model (RCA4).\n\nThis dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nHorizontal coverage\t\n\nPOLCOMS-ERSEM: Northwest European Shelf and Mediterranean Sea (20W to 37E, 11N to 65N)\n\nNEMO-ERSEM: Northwest European Shelf (20W to 13E, 40N to 65N)\n\n\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\nPOLCOMS-ERSEM: 0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0 (approx. 11km)\n\nNEMO-ERSEM: 0.06\u00b0 x 0.06\u00b0 (approx. 7km)\n\n\nVertical coverage\t0-5500 m below sea level\nVertical resolution\t\n\nPOLCOMS-ERSEM: 43 vertical levels\n\nNEMO-ERSEM: 43 vertical levels\n\n\nTemporal coverage\t\n\nPOLCOMS-ERSEM: 2006 up to 2100\n\nNEMO-ERSEM: 2006 up to 2050\n\n\nTemporal resolution\tDaily and/or monthly.

Such differences typically occur when biological activity acts to change the ambient concentration of oxygen. For example, molecular oxygen is produced during photosynthesis, which increases its concentration, while oxygen is consumed during respiration which decreases its concentration. The AOU represents the sum of the biological activity that a sample has experienced since it was last in equilibrium with the atmosphere. It is a 4D field (time, location, depth) which has the same units as dissolved oxygen. In shallow waters, the full water column is generally in close contact with the atmosphere and AOU values are low, since oxygen is close to its saturation concentration. However, in deeper waters that are relatively isolated from the atmosphere, large AOU values are possible.\nEuphotic zone chlorophyll-a\tkg m-3\tThis is a 4D field (time, location, depth), from which the surface chlorophyll-a field is calculated by taking the average concentration over one optical depth. Here, optical depth is taken to be the depth at which downwelling irradiance has been reduced to 1% of that at the surface \u2013 a level that is often used to define the base of the euphotic zone. Note this measure of optical depth is different to the e-folding length scale which is commonly used in satellite applications, for example.\nEuphotic zone depth\tm\tEuphotic zone depth is taken to be the depth at which downwelling irradiance has been reduced to 1% of that at the surface \u2013 a level that is often used to define the base of the euphotic zone. Note this measure of optical depth is different to the e-folding length scale which is commonly used in satellite applications.\nMole concentration of dissolved oxygen\tmol m-3\tThe presence of oxygen is an essential pre-requisite for all forms of complex marine life, including commercially exploited species of fish and shell fish. Its concentration is influenced by multiple processes, including air-sea gas exchange, production through oxygenic photosynthesis and consumption via respiration. Surface oxygen concentrations are strongly influenced by air-sea gas exchange, and oxygen is generally in plentiful supply in surface ocean waters. However, in deeper waters oxygen may become depleted due to the activity of bacteria and other organisms that consume oxygen during respiration; if the rate of consumption exceeds the rate of supply, then oxygen levels will fall. Oxygen concentrations above 190 mmol m-3 are considered to be sufficient to support healthy marine communities with minimal problems, while oxygen concentrations below 62.5 mmol m-3 are considered to be a source of serious concern. The concentration of dissolved molecular oxygen is a 4D field (time, location, depth), and is calculated by the coupled model.\nMole concentration of nitrate and nitrite\tmol m-3\tBoth nitrate (NO3-) and nitrite (NO2-) are taken up from sea water by marine phytoplankton, which incorporate the nitrogen into new biomass as they grow. Nitrogen is an essential element for phytoplankton, and the amount available strongly influences their potential for growth. In the model, nitrate and nitrite are represented by a single state variable. The concentration field is 4D (time, location, depth). Across much of the model domain, there are large seasonal variations in the near surface concentration of nitrate and nitrite: during the spring, phytoplankton draw the concentration down as they grow; concentrations can remain low for much of the summer, before being replenished via mixing with deeper, nutrient rich waters during the winter months. Several other factors influence the concentration of nitrate and nitrite, include inputs from rivers, atmospheric deposition, and various biological processes involved in the break down or organic material by marine bacteria.\nMole concentration of phosphate\tmol m-3\tThe mole concentration of phosphate in sea water. Phosphate (PO43-) is taken up from sea water by marine phytoplankton which incorporate the phosphorous into new biomass as they grow. Phosphorous is an essential element for phytoplankton, and the amount available strongly influences their potential for growth. The phosphate concentration field is 4D (time, location, depth). Across much of the model domain, there are large seasonal variations in the near surface concentration of phosphate: during the spring, phytoplankton draw the concentration down as they grow; concentrations can remain low for much of the summer, before being replenished via mixing with deeper, nutrient rich waters during the winter months. Several other factors influence the concentration of phosphate, include inputs from rivers and various biological processes involved in the break down or organic material by marine bacteria.\nMole concentration of silicate\tmol m-3\tSilicate (SiO4) is taken up from sea water by a number of marine organisms, the most important of which in the context of marine biogeochemical cycles are the diatoms. Diatoms are a major group of phytoplankton that utilize silicic acid \u2013 the primary form of silicate in sea water \u2013 to build their cell wall. Diatoms often dominate the phytoplankton community and are major contributors to marine primary production. They also play a disproportionately important role in carbon export \u2013 the process by which carbon is transferred to the deep ocean from productive near surface waters \u2013 which in turn impacts the long-term ability of the ocean to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Their potential to become limited by the concentration of silicate in sea water has motivated the explicit inclusion of silicate in many marine biogeochemical models, including ERSEM. The silicate concentration field is 4D (time, location, depth), and is calculated by the coupled model.\nNet primary production\tmol m-3 s-1\tNet primary production is the excess of gross primary production (rate of synthesis of biomass from inorganic precursors) by autotrophs (\u201cproducers\u201d, which is this case are photosynthetic phytoplankton), over the rate at which the autotrophs themselves respire some of this biomass. In the oceans, carbon production per unit volume is often found at a number of depths at a given horizontal location. That quantity can then be integrated to calculate production per unit area at the location. Here, it is a 4D field (time, location, depth) that is made up of contributions from the four different phytoplankton groups included in ERSEM. Net primary production is a critical measure of marine ecosystem function, since it represents the amount of carbon and energy that is available to organisms higher up the food chain. The area covered by the model domain is characterized by large spatial and seasonal variations in net primary production, which reflect differences in environmental conditions (e.g. the availability of light and nutrients).\nOrganic carbon in the water column\tmol m-3\tThe mole concentration of non-living organic carbon in sea water. The total amount of non-living organic carbon is made up of dissolved and particulate components. The dissolved component includes unstable carbon rich compounds (e.g. sugars) which may have been secreted by phytoplankton cells, and more refractory forms which can persist in the oceans for many years. The particulate forms include contributions from dead cells and zooplankton faecal pellets.\nPhytoplankton carbon\tmol m-3\tThe mole concentration of phytoplankton carbon in sea water. Phytoplankton are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. The mole concentration of phytoplankton carbon corresponds to the amount of carbon contained within the molecules that make up phytoplankton cells. In ERSEM, the total amount of phytoplankton carbon is made up of contributions from the four different phytoplankton groups: diatoms, and three groups that are primarily distinguished by their size, which are the pico-, nano- and micro-phytoplankton. The classification reflects a choice made within the model regarding how to represent the multitude of different phytoplankton taxa that can be found in the ocean. The mole concentration of phytoplankton carbon is a 4D field (time, location, depth), which exhibits large spatial and temporal variations across the model domain\nPotential energy anomaly\tJ m-3\tStratification indices describe the extent to which vertical mixing between bodies of water with distinct physical properties is suppressed. The potential energy anomaly is a quantitative measure of stratification that represents the work required to bring about complete mixing of a column of water. It is a 3D field (time, location). The higher the potential anomaly, the more stratified the water column. A potential energy anomaly of zero is indicative of a fully mixed water column. Temperate shelf seas are often seasonally stratified, with vertical mixing suppressed from the spring through to the autumn.\nSaturation state of aragonite\tDimensionless\tAragonite is one of the more soluble forms of calcium carbonate. It is widely used by calcifying marine organisms, including corals and certain types of phytoplankton, to build physical structures. The saturation state of aragonite is dependent on the seawater chemistry of calcium and carbonate ions. When the saturation state of seawater is greater than one, it is said to be supersaturated with respect to aragonite, making it possible for marine organisms to generate physical structures made from aragonite. When the saturation state is less than one, the seawater is said to be under-saturated with respect to aragonite, meaning the aragonite mineral tends to dissolve in seawater. When carbon dioxide is added to the sea from the atmosphere the pH tends to fall, which in turn acts to reduce the saturation state of seawater with respect to aragonite. For this reason, the saturation state of aragonite is widely used to track ocean acidification. The aragonite saturation state is a 4D field (time, location, depth) and is calculated by ERSEM.\nSea water pH\tDimensionless\tpH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. The more hydrogen ions that are present, the more acidic is the solution. The pH scale ranges from zero (very acidic) to 14 (very basic). A pH of 7 is neutral, a pH less than 7 is acidic, and a pH greater than 7 is basic. Today, ocean water is normally slightly basic, with a surface-water pH of about 8.1. pH is measured on a logarithmic scale, meaning a single unit corresponds to a ten-fold difference. Ocean pH is a 4D field (time, location, depth) and is calculated by ERSEM. It is a function of several other variables, including the amount of inorganic carbon in sea water; the pH of sea water falls (i.e. it becomes more acidic) as more carbon dioxide is taken up from the atmosphere by the ocean. Changes in ocean pH can directly impact many marine organisms, including certain types of phytoplankton.\nSea water potential temperature\tK\tThe temperature a parcel of sea water would have if moved adiabatically to sea level pressure. The potential temperature field is 4D (time, location, depth), and is calculated by the physical circulation model. The area covered by the model domain is characterized by large latitudinal and seasonal variations in surface temperature, with the lowest surface temperatures found in the northern reaches of the domain, where typical values are a few degrees above zero in winter. In contrast, in the southern reaches of the domain, surface temperatures can exceed 25 deg. C in the summer. Away from the surface, and especially in deeper waters off the continental shelf, temperatures are generally more stable with a typical value being a few degrees above zero. The temperature of sea water influences ocean currents and mixing. It also influences many biological processes, and species are generally adapted to a specific range of temperatures.\nSea water salinity\tPSU\tThe salt content of sea water as measured on the practical salinity scale. The sea water practical salinity field is 4D (time, location, depth), and is calculated by the physical circulation model. Within the model domain, low salinity values can be found near to sources of freshwater such as river mouths. The Mediterranean Sea is characterized by relatively high salinity values, which may approach 40 PSU (practical salinity units). The salinity of sea water influences ocean currents and mixing.\nSecondary production\tmol m-3 s-1\tSecondary production is the difference between the organic carbon consumed by zooplankton and zooplankton respiration which produces inorganic carbon. It is a 4D field (time, location, depth) and is made up of contributions from the three different zooplankton groups included in ERSEM. Secondary production is a key measure of marine ecosystem function, in part because it determines the amount of carbon and energy available to commercially exploited species of fish and shell fish higher up the food chain. The area covered by the model domain is characterized by large spatial and seasonal variations in net primary production, which reflect differences in food availability and environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, which controls key metabolic rates)\nTotal chlorophyll-a\tkg m-3\tChlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. In the ocean, chlorophyll-a is commonly used as an index for phytoplankton abundance. However, the relationship is not direct, in part due to a process called photoadaptation, in which cells down-regulate the synthesis of pigments in high light environments. A model of photoadaptation is included in ERSEM, meaning the intracellular ratio of phytoplankton Chlorophyll-a to carbon can change in response to changes in simulated environmental conditions. In ERSEM, the dynamics of four different phytoplankton groups are modelled. Each group independently regulates its concentration of chlorophyll-a, which is used to calculate photosynthetic rates. The total chlorophyll-a field is the sum of the contribution from the four different groups.\nZooplankton carbon\tmol m-3\tZooplankton are heterotrophic organisms that feed on both living and non-living organic matter within the water column. The mole concentration of zooplankton carbon corresponds to the amount of carbon contained within the molecules that make up their bodies. In ERSEM, the total amount of zooplankton carbon is made up of contributions from three different zooplankton groups that are primarily distinguished by their size: heterotrophic nanoflagellates, microzooplankton and mesozooplankton. The classification reflects a choice made within the model regarding how to represent the multitude of different zooplankton taxa that can be found in the ocean. The mole concentration of zooplankton carbon is a 4D field (time, location, depth), which exhibits large spatial and temporal variations across the model domain.\nu-velocity component\tm s-1\tEastward horizontal surface velocity of a water parcel, as calculated by the physical circulation model. The horizontal surface velocity is a vector quantity, which is broken up into Northward and Eastward components. \u201cEastward\u201d indicates a vector component which is positive when directed eastward (negative westward). Several factors can influence the horizontal velocity field, and thus drive ocean currents. Across the continental shelf, and especially in near shore environments, the effect of tides is often evident and can drive ocean currents with speeds well in-excess of 1 m s-1. Due to the period of tides, the velocity components are computed as 25 hour mean value\nv-velocity component\tm s-1\tNorthward horizontal surface velocity of a water parcel, as calculated by the physical circulation model. The horizontal surface velocity is a vector quantity, which is broken up into Northward and Eastward components. \"Northward\" indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward).

The climate-relevant indicators for the energy sector considered are: air temperature, precipitation, incoming solar radiation, wind speed at 10 m and 100 m, and mean sea level air pressure. The energy indicators are: electricity demand, wind (both on- and off-shore), solar and hydro (run-of-river and reservoir) power. Depending on the indicator, the data are available at the national, regional and grid (ca 30km) level for most European countries. The spatial aggregation of data over land uses the Eurostat NUTS0 & NUTS2 (Nomenclature des unit\u00e9s territoriales statistiques, 2016) regions. The offshore variables (e.g. offshore wind power) use the European maritime region definitions MAR0 and MAR1. Further information on the NUTS and MAR regions can be found in the documentation.\n\nThe C3S Energy operational service is composed of three main streams: historical (1979-present), seasonal forecasts and projections (typically covering the period 1970-2100). This historical dataset (1979-present) produces reference climate variables based on the ERA5 reanalysis. Energy variables are generated by transforming the climate variables using a combination of statistical models and physically based data. A comprehensive set of measured energy supply and demand data has been collected from various sources such as the European Network of Transmission System Operators (ENTSO-E). These data provide a crucial reference to assess the robustness of the models used to convert climate into electric energy variables.\n\nSimilar datasets derived from seasonal forecasts and climate projections are also available in the Climate data store.\n\nData is provided for the European domain, in a multi-variable, multi-timescale view of the climate and energy systems. This is beneficial in anticipating important climate-driven changes in the energy sector, through either long-term planning or medium-term operational activities.

The data are bias adjusted using the Distribution Based Scaling (DBS) method versus the global reference dataset HydroGFD2.0, both bias adjustment method and global reference dataset developed by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI).\n\nThe DBS method is a parametric quantile-mapping variant. This type of methods fit a statistical distribution to the cumulative distribution function and use those fitted distributions to conduct the quantile-mapping. Here, we used a double-gamma distribution (i.e. separate gamma distributions for the bulk and the high tail) for precipitation and the normal distribution for all temperature variables. Temperature corrections were done conditional on the wet/dry state of the corresponding precipitation time series. The seasonal variations in the biases were represented by monthly parameter windows for precipitation and a smoothed seasonal cycle for the temperature distribution parameters. The smoothing was done using twelve harmonic components.\n\nThere is some post-processing in place for the data set to be suitable for hydrological impact modeling. Bias-adjustment of daily mean, maximum and minimum temperature using quantile mapping can in some cases lead to inconsistencies. For instance, maximum (minimum) temperature could be lower (higher) than mean temperature. If such inconsistencies occur, daily minimum and maximum temperatures are adjusted in such a way that the anomalies with respect to the daily mean temperature are in line with the climatological anomalies for the particular day in the seasonal cycle. This means, for example, that an inconsistency occurring on June 25 will be adjusted using the climatological anomalies for June 25, estimated by a moving window. Also, the adjustment is done conditional on the wet/dry state of the corresponding precipitation series. The climatology of the anomalies was derived from the HydroGFD2.0 dataset.\n\nIn addition, DBS\u2019s limitations lead to some data not being bias-adjusted or values beyond physically plausible ranges. In those cases, DBS gives missing values as output. Grid cells where the DBS method resulted in such missing values have been interpolated in time or space.

The dataset consists of 39 indicators of atmospheric and snow conditions computed in a similar manner for all mountain regions in Europe at the scale of NUTS-3 regions (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) and by steps of 100 m elevation. The snow indicators are generated using the Crocus snowpack model, a multi-layer snowpack model embedded in the land surface model, SURFEX (Surface Externalis\u00e9e). In order to assess the impact of climate change, the model is run for four different climate scenarios: the present climate (labelled 'historical'), and three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios that correspond to an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2020 (RCP2.6), a further optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century, often called the high emission scenario (RCP8.5). In order to simulate these climate scenarios the SURFEX model is forced with atmospheric fields provided by adjusted EURO-CORDEX ensemble climate projections (European branch of the Coordinated Downscaling Experiment). Regional climate models downscaled from global climate models are used to provide the high resolution, pan-European, indicators required to assess the snow reliability for all mountainous regions across Europe. In addition to the climate scenarios, a reanalysis dataset is computed using UERRA reanalysis.\n\nA total of 39 indicators are made available in this dataset, divided into seven distinct groups:\n\nStart and end date of snow season\nAnnual amount of machine made snow produced\nPrecipitation\nSnow depth\nSnow water equivalent\nAir temperature\nPotential snow making hours\n\nThe Crocus model makes it possible to account for both snow grooming and mechanical snow-making based upon the physical representation of these snow management practices, adding further value to the end-user by providing indicated snow management requirements under future climate conditions. However, it is not designed to replace higher resolution products available in some European regions that provide a more detailed view of ski conditions; for example, accounting for slope, local meteorological phenomena and local snow management practices. Instead this dataset presents a homogenous product at a pan-European level and hence its main goal is to compare the main features of past and future snow conditions across Europe or to compare distant destinations; for example, Scandinavia and Eastern Europe (for a given elevation and time horizon).\n\nThis dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tTime series\nHorizontal coverage\tEurope\nHorizontal resolution\tNUTS-3 regions\nVertical coverage\tVariables are provided on a single level which may differ among variables\nVertical resolution\t100 m\nTemporal coverage\tFrom 1950 to 2100\nTemporal resolution\t\n\nAnnual data: yearly\n\nClimatology: 20-30 year aggregation\n\n\nFile format\tNetCDF-4\nConventions\tClimate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.7\nUpdate frequency\tNo updates expected\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nAnnual amount of machine made snow produced\tkg m-2\tThe total amount of machine made snow for the period August 1st of year N-1 to July 31st of year N, where N is the selected year.\nEnd of the longest period with groomed snow\tday\tIdentified longest continuous period from August 1st of year N-1 to July 31st of year N where the snow depth is continuously above 30 cm using a groomed snow simulation.

The derived indicators are gathered in the present catalogue and distributed as monthly decadal projections. The skill of 25 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) climate projection models was assessed against the historical sea ice concentration from ERA-Interim. The 5 most skillful CMIP5 models were used (relative root mean square error < 10%) to derive the present indicators. Both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 CMIP5 experiments were considered.\n\nTwo different types of indicators were produced. The first type provides information about the ice and accessibility conditions over the whole arctic ocean and includes: Sea ice extent maps, accessibility maps for different ice classes and average sea ice concentration and thickness conditions maps.\n\nThe second type of indicators (e.g. trip duration, fuel consumption) provides information about the navigation conditions along a specific arctic route going through the so-called North-East Passage for an ARC4 bulk carrier.\n\nDue to the global warming and the continuous decline of Arctic sea ice, maritime transport in the Arctic region has been increased dramatically. While operating in the Arctic area, ships face regular environment loads and ice loads synchronously, the consideration of ice resistance is essential for the fuel consumption estimation in the ice-covered water voyage. For this specific bulk carrier, the Arctic sailing cost is composed of the following operational costs: the insurance cost is assumed to be 500usd/day, the ship renting cost is assumed to be 40kusd/day and the crew cost (including wages, social benefits, entertainments, etc.) is assumed to be 6kusd/day.\n\nThe other big category of the cost is associated with the fuel cost. The fuel cost is computed by first estimating the ship\u2019s resistance in the still water and in various ice conditions along the arctic ship route. It should be noted that since in the climate projection data does not contain the wave and wind information, the resistance caused by wind and wave will be neglected in the calculation. The calm/still water resistance is estimated by the well-known formula proposed by Holtrop and Mennen (1982). The ice resistance is estimated by the method proposed by Lindqvist (1989), which divides resistance components into ice crushing, bending-induced breaking and submergence, based on the physical phenomena. This method gives ice resistance as functions of ship main dimensions, hull form, ice thickness, ice friction and ice strength.\n\nAfter getting the ship resistance for various ice conditions and operational conditions (ship speed), it will be divided by the propulsion efficiency of the ship to get the require marine engine power, that can push the ship forward to overtake the still water and ice resistance.

In this dataset, daily FWI values, seasonal FWI values, and other FWI derived, threshold-specific, indicators were modelled using the GEFF model to estimate the fire danger in future climate scenarios. These indicators include the number of days with moderate, high, or very high fire danger conditions as classified by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) during the northern hemisphere's fire season (June-September):\n\nvery low: <5.2\nlow: 5.2 - 11.2\nmoderate: 11.2 - 21.3\nhigh: 21.3 - 38.0\nvery high: 38.0 - 50\nextreme: >=50.0\n\nThis dataset may serve to assess future fire danger conditions for regions across Europe and support the development of a long-term tourism strategy to reduce the risk of forest fires on nature-based tourism infrastructure.\n\nThe FWI is a meteorologically based index that accounts for the effect of fuel moisture and weather conditions on fire behaviour. Daily noon values of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and 24-h accumulated precipitation are required for the calculation of the index. In order to attain the meteorological variables, projections from multiple global climate models downscaled to a regional climate model were used as input to the GEFF model. The climate models were developed within the EURO-CORDEX initiative, providing high-resolution and comparable model output centered on the European domain. In order to assess the impact of climate change, the GEFF model is run for four different climate scenarios: the present climate (labelled 'historical'), and three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios consistent with an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2020 (RCP2.6), a scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century (RCP8.5). Historical simulations, for the period 1970-2005, are included to provide a reference for the FWI projections. An estimate of the statistical uncertainty associated with climate projections may be derived with the use of multiple climate model outcomes. This may be achieved by the user both implicitly or explicitly by selecting from a choice of mean, best case, or worst case multi-model outcomes.

These indicators have been tailored for two different kinds of tourism activities; urban and beach tourism. The climatic suitability indicators consist of two indices; the Holiday Climate Index (HCI) rates the climate resources based on activities associated with urban tourism, while the Climate Index for Tourism (CIT) rates the climate resources based on activities associated with beach tourism. Tailored indicators, such as these, allow a range of climatic variables to be quantified and ranked for particular tourist destinations and activities, serving as an important decision-making tool for both tourists and the tourism industry. The use of indicators is particularly valuable given the multifaceted nature of meteorological conditions and the complex manner in which they determine tourism activities. By integrating these indicators with climate projections, this dataset aims to provide an understanding of how the influence of a changing climate will impact on tourism activities in Europe under a range of future scenarios of greenhouse gas concentrations, referred to as Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) climate scenarios. This dataset was produced using four different climate scenarios: the present climate (labelled 'historical'), and three Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios consistent with an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2020 (RCP2.6), a scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century (RCP8.5).\n\nThe climate projections are derived from EURO-CORDEX ensemble model output.

Both these indices take into account different climate variables (daily precipitation, wind speed, total cloud cover, and effective temperature) to evaluate the climate in relation to tourism. To each of these climate variables, a score is assigned according to their weighting criteria. The scores are then aggregated, resulting in a total rating scale ranging from 0 to 100 for HCI, and from 0 to 7 for CIT (please refer to the documentation for further details).

These indicators are produced by various hydrological models using input variables of historical and projected precipitation, temperature and potential evapotranspiration.\n\nThe indicators transform data from climate projections into usable information for the European water sector. They were defined in discussion with stakeholder groups working in different areas of the water sector (hydropower, irrigation, water supply) to provide clear information on climate projections for water resources as annual, seasonal and monthly change factors for a range of variables.\n\nA range of global climate models and standard projection scenarios (based on latest Copernicus Climate Change Service and Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 climate modelling experiments) were used along a multi-hydrological model approach to produce these indicators.\n\nThis ensemble approach to the climate and hydrological modelling captures the uncertainty and variability of the hydrological regime.

The dataset provides an understanding of European coastal hydrodynamics under the impact of climate change (e.g. sea level rise) and can be used to provide added value to various coastal sectors and studies such as coastal flooding, coastal erosion, harbours and ports.\n\nTo compute these time series, the Deltares Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM) version 3.0 is used together with regional climate forcing and sea level rise initial conditions. The regional climate forcing employed is the HIRHAM5 model from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), a member of the EURO-CORDEX climate model ensemble, which is downscaled from the global climate model EC-EARTH. By using a regional climate model and a high-resolution forcing field, GTSM is able to produce a more consistent and high quality dataset. In order to assess the impact of climate change, the GTSM model is run for three different climate scenarios: the present climate (labelled 'historical'), and two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios that correspond to an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century often called the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Given that the projections of these climate scenarios are based on a single combination of the regional and global climate models, users of these data should take in consideration that there is an inevitable underestimation of the uncertainty associated with this dataset. In addition to the climate scenarios, a reanalysis dataset is computed by forcing GTSM with ERA5 reanalysis.

Extinction coefficients are provided on multiple levels through the atmosphere.\nAerosol layer height\tkm\tAerosol layer height (ALH), provides the average altitude of the aerosol loading. It can be interpreted as the height level at which the largest aerosol extinction is observed. Aerosol layer height is is derived from observations collected by different sensors.\nAerosol optical depth\tDimensionless\tAerosol optical depth (AOD, or sometimes Aerosol optical thickness) is a measure of the degree to which transmission of light through a volume of atmosphere is reduced due to extinction (scattering and absorption) by aerosol. It is equivalent to the integral of the extinction coefficient over a vertical column of unit cross section. Typical global average aerosol optical depth is about 0.15; in rare cases atmospheric aerosol optical depth can reach 3. Typically aerosol optical depth observations are reported at the mid-visible reference wavelength of 550 nm.\nDust aerosol layer height\tkm\tAerosol layer height specific to dust type aerosol.\nDust aerosol optical depth\tDimensionless\tDust aerosol optical depth (DAOD) is the part of total aerosol optical depth resulting from the presence of mineral dust particles (emitted from deserts such as the Sahara and potentially transported in the atmosphere over thousands of kilometers). Dust aerosol optical depth is helpful for constraining the type of aerosol.\nFine mode aerosol optical depth\tDimensionless\tFine mode aerosol optical depth (FMAOD) is the part of total aerosol optical depth resulting from the presence of aerosol particles with diameter smaller than 1 micrometer (this includes mostly secondary aerosols from combustion and fires such as sulfates, nitrates, black and brown carbon). Fine mode aerosol optical depth is helpful for constraining the type of aerosol.\nSingle scattering albedo\tDimensionless\tSingle scattering albedo (SSA), provides the fraction of total aerosol extinction that results from scattering (as opposed to absorbtion) of light by aerosol particles.

For example, ocean temperatures typically vary slowly, on timescales of weeks or months; as the ocean has an impact on the overlaying atmosphere, the variability of its properties (e.g. temperature) can modify both local and remote atmospheric conditions. Such modifications of the 'usual' atmospheric conditions are the essence of all long-range (e.g. seasonal) forecasts. This is different from a weather forecast, which gives a lot more precise detail - both in time and space - of the evolution of the state of the atmosphere over a few days into the future. Beyond a few days, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere limits the possibility to predict precise changes at local scales. This is one of the reasons long-range forecasts of atmospheric conditions have large uncertainties. To quantify such uncertainties, long-range forecasts use ensembles, and meaningful forecast products reflect a distributions of outcomes.\n\nGiven the complex, non-linear interactions between the individual components of the Earth system, the best tools for long-range forecasting are climate models which include as many of the key components of the system and possible; typically, such models include representations of the atmosphere, ocean and land surface. These models are initialised with data describing the state of the system at the starting point of the forecast, and used to predict the evolution of this state in time. While uncertainties coming from imperfect knowledge of the initial conditions of the components of the Earth system can be described with the use of ensembles, uncertainty arising from approximations made in the models are very much dependent on the choice of model. A convenient way to quantify the effect of these approximations is to combine outputs from several models, independently developed, initialised and operated.\n\nTo this effect, the C3S provides a multi-system seasonal forecast service, where data produced by state-of-the-art seasonal forecast systems developed, implemented and operated at forecast centres in several European countries is collected, processed and combined to enable user-relevant applications.

The indicators are computed from tidal dynamics, storm surge and sea level rise data based upon past observational data and future climate projections. This dataset provides an understanding of the European coastal hydrodynamics under the impact of climate change. It provides added value for various coastal sectors and studies such as port, shipping, and coastal management.\n\nTo compute these indicators, the Deltares Global Tide and Surge Model (GTSM) version 3.0 is used together with regional climate forcing and sea level rise initial conditions. The regional climate forcing employed is the HIRHAM5 model from the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI), a member of the EURO-CORDEX climate model ensemble, which is downscaled from the global climate model EC-EARTH. By using a regional climate model and a high-resolution forcing field, GTSM is able to produce a more consistent and high quality dataset. In order to assess the impact of climate change, the GTSM model is run for three different climate scenarios: the present climate (labelled 'historical'), and two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios that correspond to an optimistic emission scenario where emissions start declining beyond 2040 (RCP4.5) and a pessimistic scenario where emissions continue to rise throughout the century often called the business-as-usual scenario (RCP8.5). Given that the projections of these climate scenarios are based on a single combination of the regional and global climate models, users of these data should take in consideration that there is an inevitable underestimation of the uncertainty associated with this dataset. In addition to the climate scenarios, a reanalysis dataset is computed by forcing GTSM with ERA5 reanalysis. This provides recent historical water-levels that can be used to look at specific (extreme) events in the past.\n\nThis dataset was produced on behalf of the Copernicus Climate Change Service.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tTime-series for a vector of point locations\nHorizontal coverage\tEurope\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\nCoastal grid points: 0.1\u00b0\n\nOcean grid points: 0.25\u00b0, 0.5\u00b0, and 1\u00b0 within 100 km, 500 km, and >500 km of the coastline, respectively\n\n\nVertical coverage\tSurface\nVertical resolution\tSingle level\nTemporal coverage\t\n\nStatistics for ERA5 reanalysis: from 1979 to 2017\n\nStatistics for historical: from 1977 to 2005\n\nStatistics for RCP8.5: from 2041 to 2070\n\nStatistics for RCP4.5: from 2071 to 2100\n\n\nTemporal resolution\tNo temporal resolution as the indicators are derived from the daily series and represents statistics over the temporal coverage\nFile format\tNetCDF-4\nConventions\tClimate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.6\nUpdate frequency\tNo updates expected\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nAnnual highest high water\tm\tAnnual highest high tide including mean sea level and sea level rise.

SST is known to be a significant driver of global weather and climate patterns and to play important roles in the exchanges of energy, momentum, moisture and gases between the ocean and atmosphere. As such, its knowledge is essential to understand and assess variability and long-term changes in the Earth\u2019s climate.\n\nThe SST data provided here are based on measurements carried out by the following infrared sensors flown onboard multiple polar-orbiting satellites: the series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometers (AVHRRs), the series of Along Track Scanning Radiometers (ATSRs), and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR).\n\nThe dataset provides SST products of different processing levels. Only Level-3 Collated and Level-4 and served through this entry in the Catalogue. Due to the large number of files at Level-2 Pre-processed and Level-3 Collated these products are served through the Climate Data Store API. For more information on how to access these levels consult the documentation.\n\nThe four types of products are:\n\nLevel-2 Pre-processed (L2P): SST data on the native satellite swath grid and derived from single-sensor measurements.\nLevel-3 Uncollated (L3U): SST product generated by regridding L2P data onto a global latitude-longitude grid.\nLevel-3 Collated (L3C): global daily (day and night) single-sensor SST product based on collated L3U data.\nLevel-4 (L4): spatially complete global SST product based on data from multiple sensors.\n\nThese products are available as Climate Data Records (CDRs), which have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to be used to assess climate variability and changes. These SST CDRs are identical to those produced as part of the European Space Agency (ESA) SST Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project. Interim CDRs (ICDRs) are produced at levels L3C and L4 within C3S to extend the baseline CDRs.

{ "Webpage": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-preliminary-back-extension", "Title": "River discharge and related forecasted data by the European Flood Awareness System", "Description": [ "This entry is a preliminary version of the ERA5 reanalysis back extension from 1950 to 1978. Although in many other respects the quality of this dataset is quite satisfactory (a document is in preparation), this preliminary data does suffer from tropical cyclones that are sometimes unrealistically intense. This is in contrast with the ERA5 product from 1979 onwards. For more details see the article, ERA5 back extension 1950-1978 (Preliminary version): tropical cyclones are too intense.\n\nAround the end of 2021 an updated version of the back extension is to be made available which will be added to the ERA5 Climate Data Store entries that currently reach back to 1979. After a yet to be determined overlap period the preliminary back extension will be deprecated.\n\nERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Currently data is available from 1950, split into Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension, this page) and from 1979 onwards (final release plus timely updates). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\n\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\n\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\n\nAn overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article. Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines.\n\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves). There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).\n\nThe present entry is \"ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1950 to 1978 (preliminary version)\".\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\nReanalysis: 0.25\u00b0x0.25\u00b0 (atmosphere), 0.5\u00b0x0.5\u00b0 (ocean waves)\n\nMean, spread and members: 0.5\u00b0x0.5\u00b0 (atmosphere), 1\u00b0x1\u00b0 (ocean waves)\n\n\nTemporal coverage\t1950 to 1978\nTemporal resolution\tHourly\nFile format\tGRIB\nUpdate frequency\tDaily\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\n100m u-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the 100 m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of 100 metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box. This parameter can be combined with the northward component to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 100 m wind.\n100m v-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the 100 m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of 100 metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box. This parameter can be combined with the eastward component to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 100 m wind.\n10m u-component of neutral wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is slower than the actual wind in stable conditions, and faster in unstable conditions. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on land surface properties or the sea state.\n10m u-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). This parameter can be combined with the V component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.\n10m v-component of neutral wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is slower than the actual wind in stable conditions, and faster in unstable conditions. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress.

It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). This parameter can be combined with the U component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.\n10m wind gust since previous post-processing\tm s-1\tMaximum 3 second wind at 10 m height as defined by WMO. Parametrization represents turbulence only before 01102008; thereafter effects of convection are included. The 3 s gust is computed every time step and and the maximum is kept since the last postprocessing.\n2m dewpoint temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur. It is a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature and pressure, it can be used to calculate the relative humidity. 2m dew point temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\n2m temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nAir density over the oceans\tkg m-3\tThis parameter is the mass of air per cubic metre over the oceans, derived from the temperature, specific humidity and pressure at the lowest model level in the atmospheric model. This parameter is one of the parameters used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nAltimeter corrected wave height\tm\tGridded bias corrected altimeter wave height data as presented to the wave model data assimilation scheme. This parameter only exists as type analysis.\nAltimeter range relative correction\tDimensionless\tGridded altimeter range correction as determined from the wave model. This parameter only exists as type analysis.\nAltimeter wave height\tm\tGridded altimeter wave height data as presented to the wave model data assimilation scheme. This parameter only exists as type analysis.\nAngle of sub-gridscale orography\tradians\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, slope and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. The angle of the sub-grid scale orography characterises the geographical orientation of the terrain in the horizontal plane (from a bird's-eye view) relative to an eastwards axis. This parameter does not vary in time.\nAnisotropy of sub-gridscale orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, slope and angle of sub-gridscale orography) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter is a measure of how much the shape of the terrain in the horizontal plane (from a bird's-eye view) is distorted from a circle. A value of one is a circle, less than one an ellipse, and 0 is a ridge. In the case of a ridge, wind blowing parallel to it does not exert any drag on the flow, but wind blowing perpendicular to it exerts the maximum drag. This parameter does not vary in time.\nBenjamin-feir index\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is used to calculate the likelihood of freak ocean waves, which are waves that are higher than twice the mean height of the highest third of waves. Large values of this parameter (in practice of the order 1) indicate increased probability of the occurrence of freak waves. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived from the statistics of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. More precisely, it is the square of the ratio of the integral ocean wave steepness and the relative width of the frequency spectrum of the waves. Further information on the calculation of this parameter is given in Section 10.6 of the ECMWF Wave Model documentation.\nBoundary layer dissipation\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy, into heat, due to small-scale motion in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These small-scale motions are called eddies or turbulence. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nBoundary layer height\tm\tThis parameter is the depth of air next to the Earth's surface which is most affected by the resistance to the transfer of momentum, heat or moisture across the surface. The boundary layer height can be as low as a few tens of metres, such as in cooling air at night, or as high as several kilometres over the desert in the middle of a hot sunny day. When the boundary layer height is low, higher concentrations of pollutants (emitted from the Earth's surface) can develop. The boundary layer height calculation is based on the bulk Richardson number (a measure of the atmospheric conditions) following the conclusions of a 2012 review.\nCharnock\tDimensionless\tThis parameter accounts for increased aerodynamic roughness as wave heights grow due to increasing surface stress. It depends on the wind speed, wave age and other aspects of the sea state and is used to calculate how much the waves slow down the wind. When the atmospheric model is run without the ocean model, this parameter has a constant value of 0.018. When the atmospheric model is coupled to the ocean model, this parameter is calculated by the ECMWF Wave Model.\nClear-sky direct solar radiation at surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of direct radiation from the Sun (also known as solar or shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth, assuming clear-sky (cloudless) conditions. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without being scattered (direct solar radiation). Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nCloud base height\tm\tThe height above the Earth's surface of the base of the lowest cloud layer, at the specified time. This parameter is calculated by searching from the second lowest model level upwards, to the height of the level where cloud fraction becomes greater than 1% and condensate content greater than 1.E-6 kg kg-1. Fog (i.e., cloud in the lowest model layer) is not considered when defining cloud base height.\nCoefficient of drag with waves\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the resistance that ocean waves exert on the atmosphere. It is sometimes also called a \"friction coefficient\". It is calculated by the wave model as the ratio of the square of the friction velocity, to the square of the neutral wind speed at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state.\nConvective available potential energy\tJ kg-1\tThis is an indication of the instability (or stability) of the atmosphere and can be used to assess the potential for the development of convection, which can lead to heavy rainfall, thunderstorms and other severe weather. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), CAPE is calculated by considering parcels of air departing at different model levels below the 350 hPa level. If a parcel of air is more buoyant (warmer and/or with more moisture) than its surrounding environment, it will continue to rise (cooling as it rises) until it reaches a point where it no longer has positive buoyancy. CAPE is the potential energy represented by the total excess buoyancy. The maximum CAPE produced by the different parcels is the value retained. Large positive values of CAPE indicate that an air parcel would be much warmer than its surrounding environment and therefore, very buoyant. CAPE is related to the maximum potential vertical velocity of air within an updraft; thus, higher values indicate greater potential for severe weather. Observed values in thunderstorm environments often may exceed 1000 joules per kilogram (J kg-1), and in extreme cases may exceed 5000 J kg-1. The calculation of this parameter assumes: (i) the parcel of air does not mix with surrounding air; (ii) ascent is pseudo-adiabatic (all condensed water falls out) and (iii) other simplifications related to the mixed-phase condensational heating.\nConvective inhibition\tJ kg-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the amount of energy required for convection to commence. If the value of this parameter is too high, then deep, moist convection is unlikely to occur even if the convective available potential energy or convective available potential energy shear are large. CIN values greater than 200 J kg-1 would be considered high. An atmospheric layer where temperature increases with height (known as a temperature inversion) would inhibit convective uplift and is a situation in which convective inhibition would be large.\nConvective precipitation\tm\tThis parameter is the accumulated precipitation that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Precipitation can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective rain rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of rainfall (rainfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Rainfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the rainfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective snowfall\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated snow that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Snowfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective snowfall rate water equivalent\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Snowfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the snowfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm thick (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nDownward UV radiation at the surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the surface. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. UV radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the Sun that has wavelengths shorter than visible light. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting system (IFS) it is defined as radiation with a wavelength of 0.20-0.44 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre). Small amounts of UV are essential for living organisms, but overexposure may result in cell damage; in humans this includes acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes and immune system. UV radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer, but some reaches the surface. The depletion of the ozone layer is causing concern over an increase in the damaging effects of UV. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nDuct base height\tm\tDuct base height as diagnosed from vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity.\nEastward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in an eastward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nEastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the eastward (westward) direction. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nEvaporation\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from the Earth's surface, including a simplified representation of transpiration (from vegetation), into vapour in the air above. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate condensation.\nForecast albedo\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by Earth's surface, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. The values of this parameter can range between zero and one. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above, land has intermediate values between about 0.1 and 0.4 and the ocean has low values of 0.1 or less. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The remainder is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The portion that is reflected by the Earth's surface depends on the albedo. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a climatological background albedo (observed values averaged over a period of several years) is used, modified by the model over water, ice and snow. Albedo is often shown as a percentage (%).\nForecast logarithm of surface roughness for heat\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the natural logarithm of the roughness length for heat. The surface roughness for heat is a measure of the surface resistance to heat transfer. This parameter is used to determine the air to surface transfer of heat. For given atmospheric conditions, a higher surface roughness for heat means that it is more difficult for the air to exchange heat with the surface. A lower surface roughness for heat means that it is easier for the air to exchange heat with the surface. Over the ocean, surface roughness for heat depends on the waves. Over sea-ice, it has a constant value of 0.001 m. Over land, it is derived from the vegetation type and snow cover.\nForecast surface roughness\tm\tThis parameter is the aerodynamic roughness length in metres. It is a measure of the surface resistance. This parameter is used to determine the air to surface transfer of momentum. For given atmospheric conditions, a higher surface roughness causes a slower near-surface wind speed. Over ocean, surface roughness depends on the waves. Over land, surface roughness is derived from the vegetation type and snow cover.\nFree convective velocity over the oceans\tm s-1\tThis parameter is an estimate of the vertical velocity of updraughts generated by free convection. Free convection is fluid motion induced by buoyancy forces, which are driven by density gradients. The free convective velocity is used to estimate the impact of wind gusts on ocean wave growth. It is calculated at the height of the lowest temperature inversion (the height above the surface of the Earth where the temperature increases with height). This parameter is one of the parameters used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nFriction velocity\tm s-1\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is a theoretical wind speed at the Earth's surface that expresses the magnitude of stress. It is calculated by dividing the surface stress by air density and taking its square root. For turbulent flow, the friction velocity is approximately constant in the lowest few metres of the atmosphere. This parameter increases with the roughness of the surface. It is used to calculate the way wind changes with height in the lowest levels of the atmosphere.\nGravity wave dissipation\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy in the mean flow, into heat, due to the effects of orographic gravity waves. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nHigh cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThe proportion of a grid box covered by cloud occurring in the high levels of the troposphere. High cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure less than 0.45 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), high cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure of less than 450 hPa (approximately 6km and above (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). The high cloud cover parameter is calculated from cloud for the appropriate model levels as described above. Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.\nHigh vegetation cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box that is covered with vegetation that is classified as \"high\". The values vary between 0 and 1 but do not vary in time. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. \"High vegetation\" consists of evergreen trees, deciduous trees, mixed forest/woodland, and interrupted forest.\nIce temperature layer 1\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 1 (0 to 7cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 2\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 2 (7 to 28cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 3\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 3 (28 to 100cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 4\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 4 (100 to 150cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nInstantaneous 10m wind gust\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the maximum wind gust at the specified time, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The WMO defines a wind gust as the maximum of the wind averaged over 3 second intervals. This duration is shorter than a model time step, and so the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) deduces the magnitude of a gust within each time step from the time-step-averaged surface stress, surface friction, wind shear and stability. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nInstantaneous eastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface at the specified time in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the eastward (westward) direction.\nInstantaneous large-scale surface precipitation fraction\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box (0-1) covered by large-scale precipitation at the specified time. Large-scale precipitation is rain and snow that falls to the Earth's surface, and is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. Precipitation can also be due to convection generated by the convection scheme in the IFS. The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.\nInstantaneous moisture flux\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the net rate of moisture exchange between the land/ocean surface and the atmosphere, due to the processes of evaporation (including evapotranspiration) and condensation, at the specified time. By convention, downward fluxes are positive, which means that evaporation is represented by negative values and condensation by positive values.\nInstantaneous northward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface at the specified time in the northward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the northward (southward) direction.\nInstantaneous surface sensible heat flux\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the transfer of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, at the specified time, through the effects of turbulent air motion (but excluding any heat transfer resulting from condensation or evaporation). The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nK index\tK\tThis parameter is a measure of the potential for a thunderstorm to develop, calculated from the temperature and dew point temperature in the lower part of the atmosphere. The calculation uses the temperature at 850, 700 and 500 hPa and dewpoint temperature at 850 and 700 hPa. Higher values of K indicate a higher potential for the development of thunderstorms. This parameter is related to the probability of occurrence of a thunderstorm: <20 K No thunderstorm, 20-25 K Isolated thunderstorms, 26-30 K Widely scattered thunderstorms, 31-35 K Scattered thunderstorms, >35 K Numerous thunderstorms.\nLake bottom temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of water at the bottom of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters). In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies. Lake depth and area fraction (cover) are kept constant in time. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters).

This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake mix-layer depth\tm\tThis parameter is the thickness of the uppermost layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters) that is well mixed and has a near constant temperature with depth (i.e., a uniform distribution of temperature with depth). Mixing can occur when the density of the surface (and near-surface) water is greater than that of the water below. Mixing can also occur through the action of wind on the surface of the water. In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies. Lake depth and area fraction (cover) are kept constant in time. Inland water bodies are represented with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below, where temperature changes with depth. The upper boundary of the thermocline is located at the mixed layer bottom, and the lower boundary of the thermocline at the lake bottom. A single ice layer is used to represent the formation and melting of ice on inland water bodies.\nLake mix-layer temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the uppermost layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters) that is well mixed and has a near constant temperature with depth (i.e., a uniform distribution of temperature with depth). Mixing can occur when the density of the surface (and near-surface) water is greater than that of the water below. Mixing can also occur through the action of wind on the surface of the water. In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies. Lake depth and area fraction (cover) are kept constant in time. Inland water bodies are represented with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below, where temperature changes with depth. The upper boundary of the thermocline is located at the mixed layer bottom, and the lower boundary of the thermocline at the lake bottom. A single ice layer is used to represent the formation and melting of ice on inland water bodies. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake shape factor\tDimensionless\tThis parameter describes the way that temperature changes with depth in the thermocline layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters) i.e., it describes the shape of the vertical temperature profile. It is used to calculate the lake bottom temperature and other lake-related parameters. In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies. Lake depth and area fraction (cover) are kept constant in time.

Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLand-sea mask\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of land, as opposed to ocean or inland waters (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters), in a grid box. This parameter has values ranging between zero and one and is dimensionless. In cycles of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) from CY41R1 (introduced in May 2015) onwards, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can be comprised of a mixture of land and inland water but not ocean. Grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of a water surface. In the latter case, the lake cover is used to determine how much of the water surface is ocean or inland water. In cycles of the IFS before CY41R1, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can only be comprised of land and those grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of ocean. In these older model cycles, there is no differentiation between ocean and inland water. This parameter does not vary in time.\nLarge scale rain rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of rainfall (rainfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Rainfall can also be generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the rainfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nLarge scale snowfall rate water equivalent\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

This parameter is the rate the snowfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nLarge-scale precipitation\tm\tThis parameter is the accumulated precipitation that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Precipitation can also be generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.

For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nLarge-scale precipitation fraction\ts\tThis parameter is the accumulation of the fraction of the grid box (0-1) that is covered by large-scale precipitation. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nLarge-scale snowfall\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated snow that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nLeaf area index, high vegetation\tm2 m-2\tThis parameter is the surface area of one side of all the leaves found over an area of land for vegetation classified as \"high\". This parameter has a value of 0 over bare ground or where there are no leaves. It can be calculated daily from satellite data. It is important for forecasting, for example, how much rainwater will be intercepted by the vegetative canopy, rather than falling to the ground. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. \"High vegetation\" consists of evergreen trees, deciduous trees, mixed forest/woodland, and interrupted forest.\nLeaf area index, low vegetation\tm2 m-2\tThis parameter is the surface area of one side of all the leaves found over an area of land for vegetation classified as \"low\". This parameter has a value of 0 over bare ground or where there are no leaves. It can be calculated daily from satellite data. It is important for forecasting, for example, how much rainwater will be intercepted by the vegetative canopy, rather than falling to the ground. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. \"Low vegetation\" consists of crops and mixed farming, irrigated crops, short grass, tall grass, tundra, semidesert, bogs and marshes, evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs, and water and land mixtures.\nLow cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by cloud occurring in the lower levels of the troposphere. Low cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure greater than 0.8 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), low cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure greater than 800 hPa (below approximately 2km (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. This parameter has values from 0 to 1.\nLow vegetation cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box that is covered with vegetation that is classified as \"low\". The values vary between 0 and 1 but do not vary in time. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. \"Low vegetation\" consists of crops and mixed farming, irrigated crops, short grass, tall grass, tundra, semidesert, bogs and marshes, evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs, and water and land mixtures.\nMaximum 2m temperature since previous post-processing\tK\tThis parameter is the highest temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland water since the parameter was last archived in a particular forecast. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nMaximum individual wave height\tm\tThis parameter is an estimate of the height of the expected highest individual wave within a 20 minute time window. It can be used as a guide to the likelihood of extreme or freak waves. The interactions between waves are non-linear and occasionally concentrate wave energy giving a wave height considerably larger than the significant wave height. If the maximum individual wave height is more than twice the significant wave height, then the wave is considered as a freak wave. The significant wave height represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves, generated by local winds and associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived statistically from the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nMaximum total precipitation rate since previous post-processing\tkg m-2 s-1\tThe total precipitation is calculated from the combined large-scale and convective rainfall and snowfall rates every time step and the maximum is kept since the last postprocessing.\nMean boundary layer dissipation\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy, into heat, due to small-scale motion in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These small-scale motions are called eddies or turbulence. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean convective precipitation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of precipitation at the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Precipitation can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the precipitation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean convective snowfall rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity) at the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.

In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the snowfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm thick (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second.

It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean eastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution.

A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere).

Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean northward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in a northward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System's sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme).

It is the mean over all frequencies and directions of the total wind-sea spectrum.\nMean potential evaporation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the extent to which near-surface atmospheric conditions are conducive to the process of evaporation. It is usually considered to be the amount of evaporation, under existing atmospheric conditions, from a surface of pure water which has the temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere and gives an indication of the maximum possible evaporation. Potential evaporation in the current ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) is based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming \"no stress from soil moisture\". In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although potential evaporation is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean runoff rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil.

This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the runoff would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nMean sea level pressure\tPa\tThis parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere at the surface of the Earth, adjusted to the height of mean sea level. It is a measure of the weight that all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface would have, if the point were located at mean sea level. It is calculated over all surfaces - land, sea and inland water. Maps of mean sea level pressure are used to identify the locations of low and high pressure weather systems, often referred to as cyclones and anticyclones. Contours of mean sea level pressure also indicate the strength of the wind. Tightly packed contours show stronger winds. The units of this parameter are pascals (Pa). Mean sea level pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).\nMean snow evaporation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the average rate of snow evaporation from the snow-covered area of a grid box into vapour in the air above.

It is the rate the precipitation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean vertical gradient of refractivity inside trapping layer\tm-1\tMean vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity inside trapping layer.\nMean vertically integrated moisture divergence\tkg m-2 s-1\tThe vertical integral of the moisture flux is the horizontal rate of flow of moisture (water vapour, cloud liquid and cloud ice), per metre across the flow, for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere.

This parameter is positive for moisture that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for moisture that is concentrating, or converging (convergence). This parameter thus indicates whether atmospheric motions act to decrease (for divergence) or increase (for convergence) the vertical integral of moisture, over the time period. High negative values of this parameter (i.e. large moisture convergence) can be related to precipitation intensification and floods. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second.\nMean wave direction\tdegree true\tThis parameter is the mean direction of ocean/sea surface waves.

In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the first swell partition might be from one system at one location and a different system at the neighbouring location). The units are degrees true which means the direction relative to the geographic location of the north pole. It is the direction that waves are coming FROM, so zero means \"coming from the north\" and 90 \"coming from the east\".\nMean wave direction of second swell partition\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the mean direction of waves in the second swell partition.

In combination with wave height information, it could be used to assess the length of time that a coastal structure might be under water, for example. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) this parameter is calculated from the characteristics of the two-dimensional wave spectrum.\nMedium cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by cloud occurring in the middle levels of the troposphere. Medium cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure between 0.45 and 0.8 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), medium cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure of less than or equal to 800 hPa and greater than or equal to 450 hPa (between approximately 2km and 6km (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). The medium cloud parameter is calculated from cloud cover for the appropriate model levels as described above. Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.\nMinimum 2m temperature since previous post-processing\tK\tThis parameter is the lowest temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters since the parameter was last archived in a particular forecast. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. See further information. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nMinimum total precipitation rate since previous post-processing\tkg m-2 s-1\tThe total precipitation is calculated from the combined large-scale and convective rainfall and snowfall rates every time step and the minimum is kept since the last postprocessing.\nMinimum vertical gradient of refractivity inside trapping layer\tm-1\tMinimum vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity inside trapping layer.\nModel bathymetry\tm\tThis parameter is the depth of water from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. It is used by the ocean wave model to specify the propagation properties of the different waves that could be present. Note that the ocean wave model grid is too coarse to resolve some small islands and mountains on the bottom of the ocean, but they can have an impact on surface ocean waves. The ocean wave model has been modified to reduce the wave energy flowing around or over features at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.\nNear IR albedo for diffuse radiation\tDimensionless\tAlbedo is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. This parameter is the fraction of diffuse solar (shortwave) radiation with wavelengths between 0.7 and 4 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre) reflected by the Earth's surface (for snow-free land surfaces only). Values of this parameter vary between 0 and 1. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) albedo is dealt with separately for solar radiation with wavelengths greater/less than 0.7\u00b5m and for direct and diffuse solar radiation (giving 4 components to albedo). Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without being scattered (direct solar radiation). In the IFS, a climatological (observed values averaged over a period of several years) background albedo is used which varies from month to month through the year, modified by the model over water, ice and snow.\nNear IR albedo for direct radiation\tDimensionless\tAlbedo is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. This parameter is the fraction of direct solar (shortwave) radiation with wavelengths between 0.7 and 4 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre) reflected by the Earth's surface (for snow-free land surfaces only). Values of this parameter vary between 0 and 1.

The energy flux is calculated from an estimation of the loss of wave energy due to white capping waves. A white capping wave is one that appears white at its crest as it breaks, due to air being mixed into the water. When waves break in this way, there is a transfer of energy from the waves to the ocean. Such a flux is defined to be negative. The energy flux has units of Watts per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the cube of the friction velocity.\nNormalized energy flux into waves\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the normalised vertical flux of energy from wind into the ocean waves. A positive flux implies a flux into the waves. The energy flux has units of Watts per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the cube of the friction velocity.\nNormalized stress into ocean\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the normalised surface stress, or momentum flux, from the air into the ocean due to turbulence at the air-sea interface and breaking waves. It does not include the flux used to generate waves. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards. The stress has units of Newtons per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the square of the friction velocity.\nNorthward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in a northward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System's sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nNorthward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface in the northward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the northward (southward) direction. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nOcean surface stress equivalent 10m neutral wind direction\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the direction from which the \"neutral wind\" blows, in degrees clockwise from true north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state. This parameter is the wind direction used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model's horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nOcean surface stress equivalent 10m neutral wind speed\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal speed of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The units of this parameter are metres per second. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state. This parameter is the wind speed used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model's horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nOrography\tm2 s-2\tThis parameter is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location at the surface of the Earth, relative to mean sea level and can be referred to as (surface) geopotential. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2 ). This parameter does not vary in time.\nPeak wave period\ts\tThis parameter represents the period of the most energetic ocean waves generated by local winds and associated with swell. The wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is calculated from the reciprocal of the frequency corresponding to the largest value (peak) of the frequency wave spectrum. The frequency wave spectrum is obtained by integrating the two-dimensional wave spectrum over all directions. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nPeriod corresponding to maximum individual wave height\ts\tThis parameter is the period of the expected highest individual wave within a 20-minute time window. It can be used as a guide to the characteristics of extreme or freak waves. Wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. Occasionally waves of different periods reinforce and interact non-linearly giving a wave height considerably larger than the significant wave height. If the maximum individual wave height is more than twice the significant wave height, then the wave is considered to be a freak wave. The significant wave height represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves, generated by local winds and associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived statistically from the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nPotential evaporation\tm\tThis parameter is a measure of the extent to which near-surface atmospheric conditions are conducive to the process of evaporation. It is usually considered to be the amount of evaporation, under existing atmospheric conditions, from a surface of pure water which has the temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere and gives an indication of the maximum possible evaporation. Potential evaporation in the current ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) is based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming \"no stress from soil moisture\". In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although potential evaporation is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nPrecipitation type\tDimensionless\tThis parameter describes the type of precipitation at the surface, at the specified time. A precipitation type is assigned wherever there is a non-zero value of precipitation. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) there are only two predicted precipitation variables: rain and snow. Precipitation type is derived from these two predicted variables in combination with atmospheric conditions, such as temperature. Values of precipitation type defined in the IFS: 0 = No precipitation 1 = Rain 3 = Freezing rain (i.e. supercooled raindrops which freeze on contact with the ground and other surfaces) 5 = Snow 6 = Wet snow (i.e. snow particles which are starting to melt) 7 = Mixture of rain and snow 8 = Ice pellets These precipitation types are consistent with WMO Code Table 4.201. 2 (thunderstorm), 4 (mixed ice), 9 (graupel), 10 (hail), 11 (drizzle) and 12 (freezing drizzle) are not diagnosed in the IFS.\nRunoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is called runoff. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of runoff are depth in metres of water. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nSea surface temperature\tK\tThis parameter (SST) is the temperature of sea water near the surface. In ERA5, this parameter is a foundation SST, which means there are no variations due to the daily cycle of the sun (diurnal variations). SST, in ERA5, is given by two external providers. Before September 2007, SST from the HadISST2 dataset is used and from September 2007 onwards, the OSTIA dataset is used. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSea-ice cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of a grid box which is covered by sea ice. Sea ice can only occur in a grid box which includes ocean or inland water according to the land sea mask and lake cover, at the resolution being used. This parameter can be known as sea-ice (area) fraction, sea-ice concentration and more generally as sea-ice cover. In ERA5, sea-ice cover is given by two external providers. Before 1979 the HadISST2 dataset is used. From 1979 to August 2007 the OSI SAF (409a) dataset is used and from September 2007 the OSI SAF oper dataset is used. Sea ice is frozen sea water which floats on the surface of the ocean. Sea ice does not include ice which forms on land such as glaciers, icebergs and ice-sheets. It also excludes ice shelves which are anchored on land, but protrude out over the surface of the ocean. These phenomena are not modelled by the IFS. Long-term monitoring of sea ice is important for understanding climate change. Sea ice also affects shipping routes through the polar regions.\nSignificant height of combined wind waves and swell\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves generated by wind and swell. It represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both. More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. This parameter can be used to assess sea state and swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant height of total swell\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with swell. It represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough.

The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of total swell only. More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional total swell spectrum. The total swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant height of wind waves\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves generated by the local wind.

For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant wave height of first swell partition\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with the first swell partition. Wave height represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the first might be from one system at one location and another system at the neighbouring location). More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the first swell partition of the two-dimensional swell spectrum. The swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell.

For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSkin reservoir content\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the amount of water in the vegetation canopy and/or in a thin layer on the soil. It represents the amount of rain intercepted by foliage, and water from dew. The maximum amount of \"skin reservoir content\" a grid box can hold depends on the type of vegetation, and may be zero. Water leaves the \"skin reservoir\" by evaporation.\nSkin temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the surface of the Earth. The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes. Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSlope of sub-gridscale orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, angle and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter represents the slope of the sub-grid valleys, hills and mountains. A flat surface has a value of 0, and a 45 degree slope has a value of 0.5. This parameter does not vary in time.\nSnow albedo\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a measure of the reflectivity of the snow-covered part of the grid box. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by snow across the solar spectrum.

It has a range of values between 0 and 1. For low vegetation, it ranges between 0.52 for old snow and 0.88 for fresh snow. For high vegetation with snow underneath, it depends on vegetation type and has values between 0.27 and 0.38.\nSnow density\tkg m-3\tThis parameter is the mass of snow per cubic metre in the snow layer. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow depth\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the amount of snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box. Its units are metres of water equivalent, so it is the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the whole grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow evaporation\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box into vapour in the air above. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. This parameter is the depth of water there would be if the evaporated snow (from the snow-covered area of a grid box) were liquid and were spread evenly over the whole grid box.

Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate deposition.\nSnowfall\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated snow that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale snowfall and convective snowfall. Large-scale snowfall is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Convective snowfall is generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nSnowmelt\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has melted from snow in the snow-covered area of a grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. This parameter is the depth of water there would be if the melted snow (from the snow-covered area of a grid box) were spread evenly over the whole grid box. For example, if half the grid box were covered in snow with a water equivalent depth of 0.02m, this parameter would have a value of 0.01m. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time.

It is derived from the root zone data (30-100 cm below the surface) of the FAO/UNESCO Digital Soil Map of the World, DSMW (FAO, 2003), which exists at a resolution of 5' X 5' (about 10 km). The seven soil types are: Coarse 1 Medium 2 Medium fine 3 Fine 4 Very fine 5 Organic 6 Tropical organic 7 This parameter does not vary in time.\nStandard deviation of filtered subgrid orography\tm\tClimatological parameter (scales between approximately 3 and 22 km are included).

These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter represents the standard deviation of the height of the sub-grid valleys, hills and mountains within a grid box.

It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed.

It is a measure of the weight of all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface. Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low and high pressure weather systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this purpose. The units of this parameter are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb= 100 Pa).\nSurface runoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil.

This parameter can also be referred to as total ozone, or vertically integrated ozone. The values are dominated by ozone within the stratosphere. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), there is a simplified representation of ozone chemistry (including representation of the chemistry which has caused the ozone hole). Ozone is also transported around in the atmosphere through the motion of air.

However, under certain wave conditions the probability density function of the sea surface elevation can deviate considerably from normality, signalling increased probability of freak waves. This parameter gives one measure of the deviation from normality. It shows how much of the probability density function of the sea surface elevation exists in the tails of the distribution. So, a positive kurtosis (typical range 0.0 to 0.06) means more frequent occurrences of very extreme values (either above or below the mean), relative to a normal distribution.\nWave spectral peakedness\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a statistical measure used to forecast extreme or freak waves. It is a measure of the relative width of the ocean/sea wave frequency spectrum (i.e., whether the ocean/sea wave field is made up of a narrow or broad range of frequencies). The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). When the wave field is more focussed around a narrow range of frequencies, the probability of freak/extreme waves increases. This parameter is Goda's peakedness factor and is used to calculate the Benjamin-Feir Index (BFI). The BFI is in turn used to estimate the probability and nature of extreme/freak waves.\nWave spectral skewness\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a statistical measure used to forecast extreme or freak ocean/sea waves. It describes the nature of the sea surface elevation and how it is affected by waves generated by local winds and associated with swell. Under typical conditions, the sea surface elevation, as described by its probability density function, has a near normal distribution in the statistical sense. However, under certain wave conditions the probability density function of the sea surface elevation can deviate considerably from normality, signalling increased probability of freak waves. This parameter gives one measure of the deviation from normality. It is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability density function of the sea surface elevation. So, a positive/negative skewness (typical range -0.2 to 0.12) means more frequent occurrences of extreme values above/below the mean, relative to a normal distribution.\nZero degree level\tm\tThe height above the Earth's surface where the temperature passes from positive to negative values, corresponding to the top of a warm layer, at the specified time. This parameter can be used to help forecast snow. If more than one warm layer is encountered, then the zero degree level corresponds to the top of the second atmospheric layer. This parameter is set to zero when the temperature in the whole atmosphere is below 0\u2103." ], "Parameters": [ "100m u-component of wind", "100m v-component of wind", "10m u-component of neutral

Although in many other respects the quality of this dataset is quite satisfactory (a document is in preparation), this preliminary data does suffer from tropical cyclones that are sometimes unrealistically intense. This is in contrast with the ERA5 product from 1979 onwards. For more details see the article, ERA5 back extension 1950-1978 (Preliminary version): tropical cyclones are too intense.\n\nAround the end of 2021 an updated version of the back extension is to be made available which will be added to the ERA5 Climate Data Store entries that currently reach back to 1979. After a yet to be determined overlap period the preliminary back extension will be deprecated.\n\nERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Currently data is available from 1950, split into Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension, this page) and from 1979 onwards (final release plus timely updates). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\n\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\n\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\n\nAn overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article. Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines.\n\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves). There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).\n\nThe present entry is \"ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1950 to 1978 (preliminary version)\".\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\nReanalysis: 0.25\u00b0x0.25\u00b0 (atmosphere), 0.5\u00b0x0.5\u00b0 (ocean waves)\n\nMean, spread and members: 0.5\u00b0x0.5\u00b0 (atmosphere), 1\u00b0x1\u00b0 (ocean waves)\n\n\nTemporal coverage\t1950 to 1978\nTemporal resolution\tMonthly\nFile format\tGRIB\nUpdate frequency\tMonthly\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\n100m u-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the 100 m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of 100 metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\n100m v-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the 100 m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of 100 metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\n10m u-component of neutral wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is slower than the actual wind in stable conditions, and faster in unstable conditions. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on land surface properties or the sea state.\n10m u-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).\n10m v-component of neutral wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is slower than the actual wind in stable conditions, and faster in unstable conditions. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on land surface properties or the sea state.\n10m v-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).\n10m wind speed\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal speed of the wind, or movement of air, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The units of this parameter are metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The eastward and northward components of the horizontal wind at 10m are also available as parameters.\n2m dewpoint temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur. It is a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature and pressure, it can be used to calculate the relative humidity. 2m dew point temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\n2m temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nAir density over the oceans\tkg m-3\tThis parameter is the mass of air per cubic metre over the oceans, derived from the temperature, specific humidity and pressure at the lowest model level in the atmospheric model. This parameter is one of the parameters used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nAngle of sub-gridscale orography\tradians\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, slope and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. The angle of the sub-grid scale orography characterises the geographical orientation of the terrain in the horizontal plane (from a bird's-eye view) relative to an eastwards axis. This parameter does not vary in time.\nAnisotropy of sub-gridscale orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, slope and angle of sub-gridscale orography) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter is a measure of how much the shape of the terrain in the horizontal plane (from a bird's-eye view) is distorted from a circle. A value of one is a circle, less than one an ellipse, and 0 is a ridge. In the case of a ridge, wind blowing parallel to it does not exert any drag on the flow, but wind blowing perpendicular to it exerts the maximum drag. This parameter does not vary in time.\nBenjamin-feir index\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is used to calculate the likelihood of freak ocean waves, which are waves that are higher than twice the mean height of the highest third of waves. Large values of this parameter (in practice of the order 1) indicate increased probability of the occurrence of freak waves. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived from the statistics of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. More precisely, it is the square of the ratio of the integral ocean wave steepness and the relative width of the frequency spectrum of the waves. Further information on the calculation of this parameter is given in Section 10.6 of the ECMWF Wave Model documentation.\nBoundary layer dissipation\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy, into heat, due to small-scale motion in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These small-scale motions are called eddies or turbulence. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nBoundary layer height\tm\tThis parameter is the depth of air next to the Earth's surface which is most affected by the resistance to the transfer of momentum, heat or moisture across the surface. The boundary layer height can be as low as a few tens of metres, such as in cooling air at night, or as high as several kilometres over the desert in the middle of a hot sunny day. When the boundary layer height is low, higher concentrations of pollutants (emitted from the Earth's surface) can develop. The boundary layer height calculation is based on the bulk Richardson number (a measure of the atmospheric conditions) following the conclusions of a 2012 review.\nCharnock\tDimensionless\tThis parameter accounts for increased aerodynamic roughness as wave heights grow due to increasing surface stress. It depends on the wind speed, wave age and other aspects of the sea state and is used to calculate how much the waves slow down the wind. When the atmospheric model is run without the ocean model, this parameter has a constant value of 0.018. When the atmospheric model is coupled to the ocean model, this parameter is calculated by the ECMWF Wave Model.\nClear-sky direct solar radiation at surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of direct radiation from the Sun (also known as solar or shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth, assuming clear-sky (cloudless) conditions. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without being scattered (direct solar radiation). Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nCloud base height\tm\tThe height above the Earth's surface of the base of the lowest cloud layer, at the specified time. This parameter is calculated by searching from the second lowest model level upwards, to the height of the level where cloud fraction becomes greater than 1% and condensate content greater than 1.E-6 kg kg-1. Fog (i.e., cloud in the lowest model layer) is not considered when defining cloud base height.\nCoefficient of drag with waves\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the resistance that ocean waves exert on the atmosphere. It is sometimes also called a \"friction coefficient\". It is calculated by the wave model as the ratio of the square of the friction velocity, to the square of the neutral wind speed at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state.\nConvective available potential energy\tJ kg-1\tThis is an indication of the instability (or stability) of the atmosphere and can be used to assess the potential for the development of convection, which can lead to heavy rainfall, thunderstorms and other severe weather. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), CAPE is calculated by considering parcels of air departing at different model levels below the 350 hPa level. If a parcel of air is more buoyant (warmer and/or with more moisture) than its surrounding environment, it will continue to rise (cooling as it rises) until it reaches a point where it no longer has positive buoyancy. CAPE is the potential energy represented by the total excess buoyancy. The maximum CAPE produced by the different parcels is the value retained. Large positive values of CAPE indicate that an air parcel would be much warmer than its surrounding environment and therefore, very buoyant. CAPE is related to the maximum potential vertical velocity of air within an updraft; thus, higher values indicate greater potential for severe weather. Observed values in thunderstorm environments often may exceed 1000 joules per kilogram (J kg-1), and in extreme cases may exceed 5000 J kg-1. The calculation of this parameter assumes: (i) the parcel of air does not mix with surrounding air; (ii) ascent is pseudo-adiabatic (all condensed water falls out) and (iii) other simplifications related to the mixed-phase condensational heating.\nConvective inhibition\tJ kg-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the amount of energy required for convection to commence. If the value of this parameter is too high, then deep, moist convection is unlikely to occur even if the convective available potential energy or convective available potential energy shear are large. CIN values greater than 200 J kg-1 would be considered high. An atmospheric layer where temperature increases with height (known as a temperature inversion) would inhibit convective uplift and is a situation in which convective inhibition would be large.\nConvective precipitation\tm\tThis parameter is the accumulated precipitation that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Precipitation can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective rain rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of rainfall (rainfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Rainfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the rainfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective snowfall\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated snow that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Snowfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective snowfall rate water equivalent\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Snowfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the snowfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm thick (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nDownward UV radiation at the surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the surface. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. UV radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the Sun that has wavelengths shorter than visible light. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting system (IFS) it is defined as radiation with a wavelength of 0.20-0.44 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre). Small amounts of UV are essential for living organisms, but overexposure may result in cell damage; in humans this includes acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes and immune system. UV radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer, but some reaches the surface. The depletion of the ozone layer is causing concern over an increase in the damaging effects of UV. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nDuct base height\tm\tDuct base height as diagnosed from vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity.\nEastward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in an eastward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nEastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the eastward (westward) direction. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nEvaporation\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from the Earth's surface, including a simplified representation of transpiration (from vegetation), into vapour in the air above. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate condensation.\nForecast albedo\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by Earth's surface, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. The values of this parameter can range between zero and one. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above, land has intermediate values between about 0.1 and 0.4 and the ocean has low values of 0.1 or less. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The remainder is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The portion that is reflected by the Earth's surface depends on the albedo. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a climatological background albedo (observed values averaged over a period of several years) is used, modified by the model over water, ice and snow. Albedo is often shown as a percentage (%).\nForecast logarithm of surface roughness for heat\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the natural logarithm of the roughness length for heat. The surface roughness for heat is a measure of the surface resistance to heat transfer. This parameter is used to determine the air to surface transfer of heat. For given atmospheric conditions, a higher surface roughness for heat means that it is more difficult for the air to exchange heat with the surface. A lower surface roughness for heat means that it is easier for the air to exchange heat with the surface. Over the ocean, surface roughness for heat depends on the waves. Over sea-ice, it has a constant value of 0.001 m. Over land, it is derived from the vegetation type and snow cover.\nForecast surface roughness\tm\tThis parameter is the aerodynamic roughness length in metres. It is a measure of the surface resistance. This parameter is used to determine the air to surface transfer of momentum. For given atmospheric conditions, a higher surface roughness causes a slower near-surface wind speed. Over ocean, surface roughness depends on the waves. Over land, surface roughness is derived from the vegetation type and snow cover.\nFree convective velocity over the oceans\tm s-1\tThis parameter is an estimate of the vertical velocity of updraughts generated by free convection. Free convection is fluid motion induced by buoyancy forces, which are driven by density gradients. The free convective velocity is used to estimate the impact of wind gusts on ocean wave growth. It is calculated at the height of the lowest temperature inversion (the height above the surface of the Earth where the temperature increases with height). This parameter is one of the parameters used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nFriction velocity\tm s-1\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is a theoretical wind speed at the Earth's surface that expresses the magnitude of stress. It is calculated by dividing the surface stress by air density and taking its square root. For turbulent flow, the friction velocity is approximately constant in the lowest few metres of the atmosphere. This parameter increases with the roughness of the surface. It is used to calculate the way wind changes with height in the lowest levels of the atmosphere.\nGravity wave dissipation\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy in the mean flow, into heat, due to the effects of orographic gravity waves. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nHigh cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThe proportion of a grid box covered by cloud occurring in the high levels of the troposphere. High cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure less than 0.45 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), high cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure of less than 450 hPa (approximately 6km and above (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). The high cloud cover parameter is calculated from cloud for the appropriate model levels as described above. Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.\nHigh vegetation cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box that is covered with vegetation that is classified as \"high\". The values vary between 0 and 1 but do not vary in time. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. \"High vegetation\" consists of evergreen trees, deciduous trees, mixed forest/woodland, and interrupted forest.\nIce temperature layer 1\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 1 (0 to 7cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 2\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 2 (7 to 28cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 3\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 3 (28 to 100cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 4\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 4 (100 to 150cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nInstantaneous 10m wind gust\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the maximum wind gust at the specified time, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The WMO defines a wind gust as the maximum of the wind averaged over 3 second intervals. This duration is shorter than a model time step, and so the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) deduces the magnitude of a gust within each time step from the time-step-averaged surface stress, surface friction, wind shear and stability. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nInstantaneous eastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface at the specified time in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the eastward (westward) direction.\nInstantaneous large-scale surface precipitation fraction\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box (0-1) covered by large-scale precipitation at the specified time. Large-scale precipitation is rain and snow that falls to the Earth's surface, and is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. Precipitation can also be due to convection generated by the convection scheme in the IFS. The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.\nInstantaneous moisture flux\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the net rate of moisture exchange between the land/ocean surface and the atmosphere, due to the processes of evaporation (including evapotranspiration) and condensation, at the specified time. By convention, downward fluxes are positive, which means that evaporation is represented by negative values and condensation by positive values.\nInstantaneous northward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface at the specified time in the northward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the northward (southward) direction.\nInstantaneous surface sensible heat flux\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the transfer of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, at the specified time, through the effects of turbulent air motion (but excluding any heat transfer resulting from condensation or evaporation). The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nK index\tK\tThis parameter is a measure of the potential for a thunderstorm to develop, calculated from the temperature and dew point temperature in the lower part of the atmosphere. The calculation uses the temperature at 850, 700 and 500 hPa and dewpoint temperature at 850 and 700 hPa. Higher values of K indicate a higher potential for the development of thunderstorms. This parameter is related to the probability of occurrence of a thunderstorm: <20 K No thunderstorm, 20-25 K Isolated thunderstorms, 26-30 K Widely scattered thunderstorms, 31-35 K Scattered thunderstorms, >35 K Numerous thunderstorms.\nLake bottom temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of water at the bottom of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters). In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies. Lake depth and area fraction (cover) are kept constant in time. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters).

Mixing can occur when the density of the surface (and near-surface) water is greater than that of the water below. Mixing can also occur through the action of wind on the surface of the water. In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies. Lake depth and area fraction (cover) are kept constant in time. Inland water bodies are represented with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below, where temperature changes with depth. The upper boundary of the thermocline is located at the mixed layer bottom, and the lower boundary of the thermocline at the lake bottom. A single ice layer is used to represent the formation and melting of ice on inland water bodies.\nLake mix-layer temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the uppermost layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters) that is well mixed and has a near constant temperature with depth (i.e., a uniform distribution of temperature with depth).

In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies. Lake depth and area fraction (cover) are kept constant in time. Inland water bodies are represented with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below, where temperature changes with depth. The upper boundary of the thermocline is located at the mixed layer bottom, and the lower boundary of the thermocline at the lake bottom. A single ice layer is used to represent the formation and melting of ice on inland water bodies. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake shape factor\tDimensionless\tThis parameter describes the way that temperature changes with depth in the thermocline layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters) i.e., it describes the shape of the vertical temperature profile. It is used to calculate the lake bottom temperature and other lake-related parameters. In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies.

This parameter has values ranging between zero and one and is dimensionless. In cycles of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) from CY41R1 (introduced in May 2015) onwards, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can be comprised of a mixture of land and inland water but not ocean. Grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of a water surface. In the latter case, the lake cover is used to determine how much of the water surface is ocean or inland water. In cycles of the IFS before CY41R1, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can only be comprised of land and those grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of ocean. In these older model cycles, there is no differentiation between ocean and inland water. This parameter does not vary in time.\nLarge scale rain rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of rainfall (rainfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Rainfall can also be generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the rainfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nLarge scale snowfall rate water equivalent\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

This parameter is the rate the snowfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nLarge-scale precipitation\tm\tThis parameter is the accumulated precipitation that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nLeaf area index, high vegetation\tm2 m-2\tThis parameter is the surface area of one side of all the leaves found over an area of land for vegetation classified as \"high\". This parameter has a value of 0 over bare ground or where there are no leaves. It can be calculated daily from satellite data. It is important for forecasting, for example, how much rainwater will be intercepted by the vegetative canopy, rather than falling to the ground. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. \"High vegetation\" consists of evergreen trees, deciduous trees, mixed forest/woodland, and interrupted forest.\nLeaf area index, low vegetation\tm2 m-2\tThis parameter is the surface area of one side of all the leaves found over an area of land for vegetation classified as \"low\".

Low cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure greater than 0.8 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), low cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure greater than 800 hPa (below approximately 2km (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. This parameter has values from 0 to 1.\nLow vegetation cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box that is covered with vegetation that is classified as \"low\". The values vary between 0 and 1 but do not vary in time. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. \"Low vegetation\" consists of crops and mixed farming, irrigated crops, short grass, tall grass, tundra, semidesert, bogs and marshes, evergreen shrubs, deciduous shrubs, and water and land mixtures.\nMagnitude of turbulent surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the magnitude of the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nMaximum individual wave height\tm\tThis parameter is an estimate of the height of the expected highest individual wave within a 20 minute time window. It can be used as a guide to the likelihood of extreme or freak waves. The interactions between waves are non-linear and occasionally concentrate wave energy giving a wave height considerably larger than the significant wave height. If the maximum individual wave height is more than twice the significant wave height, then the wave is considered as a freak wave. The significant wave height represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves, generated by local winds and associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived statistically from the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nMean boundary layer dissipation\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy, into heat, due to small-scale motion in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These small-scale motions are called eddies or turbulence. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean convective precipitation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of precipitation at the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Precipitation can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the precipitation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean convective snowfall rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity) at the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Snowfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger.

The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of all swell only. It is the mean over all frequencies and directions of the total swell spectrum.

(The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere).

A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains.

It is usually considered to be the amount of evaporation, under existing atmospheric conditions, from a surface of pure water which has the temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere and gives an indication of the maximum possible evaporation. Potential evaporation in the current ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) is based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming \"no stress from soil moisture\". In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although potential evaporation is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air.

It is a measure of the weight that all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface would have, if the point were located at mean sea level. It is calculated over all surfaces - land, sea and inland water. Maps of mean sea level pressure are used to identify the locations of low and high pressure weather systems, often referred to as cyclones and anticyclones. Contours of mean sea level pressure also indicate the strength of the wind. Tightly packed contours show stronger winds. The units of this parameter are pascals (Pa). Mean sea level pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).\nMean snow evaporation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the average rate of snow evaporation from the snow-covered area of a grid box into vapour in the air above.

It is the sum of the rates due to large-scale precipitation and convective precipitation. Large-scale precipitation is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Convective precipitation is generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.

It is the rate the precipitation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean vertical gradient of refractivity inside trapping layer\tm-1\tMean vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity inside trapping layer.\nMean vertically integrated moisture divergence\tkg m-2 s-1\tThe vertical integral of the moisture flux is the horizontal rate of flow of moisture (water vapour, cloud liquid and cloud ice), per metre across the flow, for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Its horizontal divergence is the rate of moisture spreading outward from a point, per square metre. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. This parameter is positive for moisture that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for moisture that is concentrating, or converging (convergence). This parameter thus indicates whether atmospheric motions act to decrease (for divergence) or increase (for convergence) the vertical integral of moisture, over the time period. High negative values of this parameter (i.e. large moisture convergence) can be related to precipitation intensification and floods. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second.\nMean wave direction\tdegree true\tThis parameter is the mean direction of ocean/sea surface waves.

In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the first swell partition might be from one system at one location and a different system at the neighbouring location). The units are degrees true which means the direction relative to the geographic location of the north pole. It is the direction that waves are coming FROM, so zero means \"coming from the north\" and 90 \"coming from the east\".\nMean wave direction of second swell partition\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the mean direction of waves in the second swell partition. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum).

The units are degrees true which means the direction relative to the geographic location of the north pole. It is the direction that waves are coming FROM, so zero means \"coming from the north\" and 90 \"coming from the east\".\nMean wave period\ts\tThis parameter is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is a mean over all frequencies and directions of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both. This parameter can be used to assess sea state and swell. For example, engineers use such wave information when designing structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nMean wave period based on first moment\ts\tThis parameter is the reciprocal of the mean frequency of the wave components that represent the sea state.

Moments are statistical quantities derived from the two-dimensional wave spectrum.\nMean wave period of first swell partition\ts\tThis parameter is the mean period of waves in the first swell partition. The wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point.

In combination with wave height information, it could be used to assess the length of time that a coastal structure might be under water, for example. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) this parameter is calculated from the characteristics of the two-dimensional wave spectrum.\nMedium cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by cloud occurring in the middle levels of the troposphere. Medium cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure between 0.45 and 0.8 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), medium cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure of less than or equal to 800 hPa and greater than or equal to 450 hPa (between approximately 2km and 6km (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). The medium cloud parameter is calculated from cloud cover for the appropriate model levels as described above. Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.\nMinimum vertical gradient of refractivity inside trapping layer\tm-1\tMinimum vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity inside trapping layer.\nModel bathymetry\tm\tThis parameter is the depth of water from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. It is used by the ocean wave model to specify the propagation properties of the different waves that could be present. Note that the ocean wave model grid is too coarse to resolve some small islands and mountains on the bottom of the ocean, but they can have an impact on surface ocean waves. The ocean wave model has been modified to reduce the wave energy flowing around or over features at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.\nNear IR albedo for diffuse radiation\tDimensionless\tAlbedo is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. This parameter is the fraction of diffuse solar (shortwave) radiation with wavelengths between 0.7 and 4 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre) reflected by the Earth's surface (for snow-free land surfaces only). Values of this parameter vary between 0 and 1. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) albedo is dealt with separately for solar radiation with wavelengths greater/less than 0.7\u00b5m and for direct and diffuse solar radiation (giving 4 components to albedo). Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without being scattered (direct solar radiation). In the IFS, a climatological (observed values averaged over a period of several years) background albedo is used which varies from month to month through the year, modified by the model over water, ice and snow.\nNear IR albedo for direct radiation\tDimensionless\tAlbedo is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. This parameter is the fraction of direct solar (shortwave) radiation with wavelengths between 0.7 and 4 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre) reflected by the Earth's surface (for snow-free land surfaces only). Values of this parameter vary between 0 and 1. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) albedo is dealt with separately for solar radiation with wavelengths greater/less than 0.7\u00b5m and for direct and diffuse solar radiation (giving 4 components to albedo).

The energy flux is calculated from an estimation of the loss of wave energy due to white capping waves. A white capping wave is one that appears white at its crest as it breaks, due to air being mixed into the water. When waves break in this way, there is a transfer of energy from the waves to the ocean. Such a flux is defined to be negative. The energy flux has units of Watts per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the cube of the friction velocity.\nNormalized energy flux into waves\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the normalised vertical flux of energy from wind into the ocean waves. A positive flux implies a flux into the waves. The energy flux has units of Watts per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the cube of the friction velocity.\nNormalized stress into ocean\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the normalised surface stress, or momentum flux, from the air into the ocean due to turbulence at the air-sea interface and breaking waves. It does not include the flux used to generate waves. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards. The stress has units of Newtons per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the square of the friction velocity.\nNorthward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in a northward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System's sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nNorthward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface in the northward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the northward (southward) direction. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nOcean surface stress equivalent 10m neutral wind direction\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the direction from which the \"neutral wind\" blows, in degrees clockwise from true north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state. This parameter is the wind direction used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model's horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nOcean surface stress equivalent 10m neutral wind speed\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal speed of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The units of this parameter are metres per second. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state. This parameter is the wind speed used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model's horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nOrography\tm2 s-2\tThis parameter is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location at the surface of the Earth, relative to mean sea level and can be referred to as (surface) geopotential. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2 ). This parameter does not vary in time.\nPeak wave period\ts\tThis parameter represents the period of the most energetic ocean waves generated by local winds and associated with swell. The wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is calculated from the reciprocal of the frequency corresponding to the largest value (peak) of the frequency wave spectrum. The frequency wave spectrum is obtained by integrating the two-dimensional wave spectrum over all directions. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nPeriod corresponding to maximum individual wave height\ts\tThis parameter is the period of the expected highest individual wave within a 20-minute time window. It can be used as a guide to the characteristics of extreme or freak waves. Wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. Occasionally waves of different periods reinforce and interact non-linearly giving a wave height considerably larger than the significant wave height. If the maximum individual wave height is more than twice the significant wave height, then the wave is considered to be a freak wave. The significant wave height represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves, generated by local winds and associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived statistically from the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nPotential evaporation\tm\tThis parameter is a measure of the extent to which near-surface atmospheric conditions are conducive to the process of evaporation. It is usually considered to be the amount of evaporation, under existing atmospheric conditions, from a surface of pure water which has the temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere and gives an indication of the maximum possible evaporation. Potential evaporation in the current ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) is based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming \"no stress from soil moisture\". In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although potential evaporation is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nPrecipitation type\tDimensionless\tThis parameter describes the type of precipitation at the surface, at the specified time. A precipitation type is assigned wherever there is a non-zero value of precipitation. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) there are only two predicted precipitation variables: rain and snow. Precipitation type is derived from these two predicted variables in combination with atmospheric conditions, such as temperature. Values of precipitation type defined in the IFS: 0 = No precipitation 1 = Rain 3 = Freezing rain (i.e. supercooled raindrops which freeze on contact with the ground and other surfaces) 5 = Snow 6 = Wet snow (i.e. snow particles which are starting to melt) 7 = Mixture of rain and snow 8 = Ice pellets These precipitation types are consistent with WMO Code Table 4.201. 2 (thunderstorm), 4 (mixed ice), 9 (graupel), 10 (hail), 11 (drizzle) and 12 (freezing drizzle) are not diagnosed in the IFS.\nRunoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is called runoff. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units of runoff are depth in metres of water. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nSea surface temperature\tK\tThis parameter (SST) is the temperature of sea water near the surface. In ERA5, this parameter is a foundation SST, which means there are no variations due to the daily cycle of the sun (diurnal variations). SST, in ERA5, is given by two external providers. Before September 2007, SST from the HadISST2 dataset is used and from September 2007 onwards, the OSTIA dataset is used. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSea-ice cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of a grid box which is covered by sea ice. Sea ice can only occur in a grid box which includes ocean or inland water according to the land sea mask and lake cover, at the resolution being used. This parameter can be known as sea-ice (area) fraction, sea-ice concentration and more generally as sea-ice cover. In ERA5, sea-ice cover is given by two external providers. Before 1979 the HadISST2 dataset is used. From 1979 to August 2007 the OSI SAF (409a) dataset is used and from September 2007 the OSI SAF oper dataset is used. Sea ice is frozen sea water which floats on the surface of the ocean. Sea ice does not include ice which forms on land such as glaciers, icebergs and ice-sheets. It also excludes ice shelves which are anchored on land, but protrude out over the surface of the ocean. These phenomena are not modelled by the IFS. Long-term monitoring of sea ice is important for understanding climate change. Sea ice also affects shipping routes through the polar regions.\nSignificant height of combined wind waves and swell\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves generated by wind and swell. It represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both. More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. This parameter can be used to assess sea state and swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant height of total swell\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with swell. It represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of total swell only. More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional total swell spectrum. The total swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant height of wind waves\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves generated by the local wind.

More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional wind-sea wave spectrum. The wind-sea wave spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are still under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess wind-sea waves. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant wave height of first swell partition\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with the first swell partition. Wave height represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the first might be from one system at one location and another system at the neighbouring location). More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the first swell partition of the two-dimensional swell spectrum. The swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant wave height of second swell partition\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with the second swell partition.

For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSkin reservoir content\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the amount of water in the vegetation canopy and/or in a thin layer on the soil. It represents the amount of rain intercepted by foliage, and water from dew. The maximum amount of \"skin reservoir content\" a grid box can hold depends on the type of vegetation, and may be zero. Water leaves the \"skin reservoir\" by evaporation.\nSkin temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the surface of the Earth. The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes. Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSlope of sub-gridscale orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, angle and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter represents the slope of the sub-grid valleys, hills and mountains. A flat surface has a value of 0, and a 45 degree slope has a value of 0.5. This parameter does not vary in time.\nSnow albedo\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a measure of the reflectivity of the snow-covered part of the grid box. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by snow across the solar spectrum. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. This parameter changes with snow age and also depends on vegetation height. It has a range of values between 0 and 1. For low vegetation, it ranges between 0.52 for old snow and 0.88 for fresh snow. For high vegetation with snow underneath, it depends on vegetation type and has values between 0.27 and 0.38.\nSnow density\tkg m-3\tThis parameter is the mass of snow per cubic metre in the snow layer.

The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow depth\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the amount of snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box. Its units are metres of water equivalent, so it is the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the whole grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow evaporation\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box into vapour in the air above. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. This parameter is the depth of water there would be if the evaporated snow (from the snow-covered area of a grid box) were liquid and were spread evenly over the whole grid box. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The IFS convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate deposition.\nSnowfall\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated snow that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale snowfall and convective snowfall. Large-scale snowfall is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger.

The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nSnowmelt\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has melted from snow in the snow-covered area of a grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. This parameter is the depth of water there would be if the melted snow (from the snow-covered area of a grid box) were spread evenly over the whole grid box. For example, if half the grid box were covered in snow with a water equivalent depth of 0.02m, this parameter would have a value of 0.01m. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.

Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSoil temperature level 2\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the soil at level 2 (in the middle of layer 2).

It is derived from the root zone data (30-100 cm below the surface) of the FAO/UNESCO Digital Soil Map of the World, DSMW (FAO, 2003), which exists at a resolution of 5' X 5' (about 10 km). The seven soil types are: Coarse 1 Medium 2 Medium fine 3 Fine 4 Very fine 5 Organic 6 Tropical organic 7 This parameter does not vary in time.\nStandard deviation of filtered subgrid orography\tm\tClimatological field (scales between approximately 3 and 22 km are included). This parameter does not vary in time.\nStandard deviation of orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being angle of sub-gridscale orography, slope and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter represents the standard deviation of the height of the sub-grid valleys, hills and mountains within a grid box. This parameter does not vary in time.\nSub-surface runoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil.

It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The difference between downward and reflected solar radiation is the surface net solar radiation.

The atmosphere and clouds emit thermal radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface as downward thermal radiation. The upward thermal radiation at the surface consists of thermal radiation emitted by the surface plus the fraction of downwards thermal radiation reflected upward by the surface.

It is a measure of the weight of all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface. Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low and high pressure weather systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this purpose. The units of this parameter are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb= 100 Pa).\nSurface runoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil.

The thermal radiation emitted to space at the top of the atmosphere is commonly known as the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) (i.e., taking a flux from the atmosphere to space as positive).

Under typical conditions, the sea surface elevation, as described by its probability density function, has a near normal distribution in the statistical sense. However, under certain wave conditions the probability density function of the sea surface elevation can deviate considerably from normality, signalling increased probability of freak waves. This parameter gives one measure of the deviation from normality. It shows how much of the probability density function of the sea surface elevation exists in the tails of the distribution. So, a positive kurtosis (typical range 0.0 to 0.06) means more frequent occurrences of very extreme values (either above or below the mean), relative to a normal distribution.\nWave spectral peakedness\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a statistical measure used to forecast extreme or freak waves. It is a measure of the relative width of the ocean/sea wave frequency spectrum (i.e., whether the ocean/sea wave field is made up of a narrow or broad range of frequencies). The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). When the wave field is more focussed around a narrow range of frequencies, the probability of freak/extreme waves increases. This parameter is Goda's peakedness factor and is used to calculate the Benjamin-Feir Index (BFI). The BFI is in turn used to estimate the probability and nature of extreme/freak waves.\nWave spectral skewness\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a statistical measure used to forecast extreme or freak ocean/sea waves. It describes the nature of the sea surface elevation and how it is affected by waves generated by local winds and associated with swell. Under typical conditions, the sea surface elevation, as described by its probability density function, has a near normal distribution in the statistical sense. However, under certain wave conditions the probability density function of the sea surface elevation can deviate considerably from normality, signalling increased probability of freak waves. This parameter gives one measure of the deviation from normality. It is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability density function of the sea surface elevation. So, a positive/negative skewness (typical range -0.2 to 0.12) means more frequent occurrences of extreme values above/below the mean, relative to a normal distribution.\nZero degree level\tm\tThe height above the Earth's surface where the temperature passes from positive to negative values, corresponding to the top of a warm layer, at the specified time. This parameter can be used to help forecast snow. If more than one warm layer is encountered, then the zero degree level corresponds to the top of the second atmospheric layer. This parameter is set to zero when the temperature in the whole atmosphere is below 0\u2103." ], "Parameters": [ "100m u-component of wind", "100m v-component of wind", "10m u-component of neutral

{ "Webpage": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-monthly-means", "Title": "ERA5 monthly averaged data on single levels from 1950 to 1978 (preliminary version)", "Description": [ "ERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Currently data is available from 1950, split into Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension) and from 1979 onwards (final release plus timely updates, this page). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\n\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\n\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days (monthly means are available around the 6th of each month). In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. So far this has not been the case and when this does occur users will be notified.\n\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\n\nAn overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article. Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines.\n\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves). There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).\n\nThe present entry is \"ERA5 monthly mean data on single levels from 1979 to present\".\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tRegular latitude-longitude grid\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\nReanalysis: 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0 (atmosphere), 0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0 (ocean waves)\n\nMean, spread and members: 0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0 (atmosphere), 1\u00b0 x 1\u00b0 (ocean waves)\n\n\nTemporal coverage\t1979 to present\nTemporal resolution\tMonthly\nFile format\tGRIB\nUpdate frequency\tMonthly\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\n100m u-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the 100 m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of 100 metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\n100m v-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the 100 m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of 100 metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\n10m u-component of neutral wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is slower than the actual wind in stable conditions, and faster in unstable conditions. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on land surface properties or the sea state.\n10m u-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).\n10m v-component of neutral wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is slower than the actual wind in stable conditions, and faster in unstable conditions. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on land surface properties or the sea state.\n10m v-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).\n10m wind speed\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal speed of the wind, or movement of air, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The units of this parameter are metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The eastward and northward components of the horizontal wind at 10m are also available as parameters.\n2m dewpoint temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur. It is a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature and pressure, it can be used to calculate the relative humidity. 2m dew point temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\n2m temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nAir density over the oceans\tkg m-3\tThis parameter is the mass of air per cubic metre over the oceans, derived from the temperature, specific humidity and pressure at the lowest model level in the atmospheric model. This parameter is one of the parameters used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nAngle of sub-gridscale orography\tradians\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, slope and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. The angle of the sub-grid scale orography characterises the geographical orientation of the terrain in the horizontal plane (from a bird's-eye view) relative to an eastwards axis. This parameter does not vary in time.\nAnisotropy of sub-gridscale orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, slope and angle of sub-gridscale orography) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter is a measure of how much the shape of the terrain in the horizontal plane (from a bird's-eye view) is distorted from a circle. A value of one is a circle, less than one an ellipse, and 0 is a ridge. In the case of a ridge, wind blowing parallel to it does not exert any drag on the flow, but wind blowing perpendicular to it exerts the maximum drag. This parameter does not vary in time.\nBenjamin-feir index\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is used to calculate the likelihood of freak ocean waves, which are waves that are higher than twice the mean height of the highest third of waves. Large values of this parameter (in practice of the order 1) indicate increased probability of the occurrence of freak waves. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived from the statistics of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. More precisely, it is the square of the ratio of the integral ocean wave steepness and the relative width of the frequency spectrum of the waves. Further information on the calculation of this parameter is given in Section 10.6 of the ECMWF Wave Model documentation.\nBoundary layer dissipation\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy, into heat, due to small-scale motion in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These small-scale motions are called eddies or turbulence. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nBoundary layer height\tm\tThis parameter is the depth of air next to the Earth's surface which is most affected by the resistance to the transfer of momentum, heat or moisture across the surface. The boundary layer height can be as low as a few tens of metres, such as in cooling air at night, or as high as several kilometres over the desert in the middle of a hot sunny day. When the boundary layer height is low, higher concentrations of pollutants (emitted from the Earth's surface) can develop. The boundary layer height calculation is based on the bulk Richardson number (a measure of the atmospheric conditions) following the conclusions of a 2012 review.\nCharnock\tDimensionless\tThis parameter accounts for increased aerodynamic roughness as wave heights grow due to increasing surface stress. It depends on the wind speed, wave age and other aspects of the sea state and is used to calculate how much the waves slow down the wind. When the atmospheric model is run without the ocean model, this parameter has a constant value of 0.018. When the atmospheric model is coupled to the ocean model, this parameter is calculated by the ECMWF Wave Model.\nClear-sky direct solar radiation at surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of direct radiation from the Sun (also known as solar or shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth, assuming clear-sky (cloudless) conditions. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without being scattered (direct solar radiation). Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nCloud base height\tm\tThe height above the Earth's surface of the base of the lowest cloud layer, at the specified time. This parameter is calculated by searching from the second lowest model level upwards, to the height of the level where cloud fraction becomes greater than 1% and condensate content greater than 1.E-6 kg kg-1. Fog (i.e., cloud in the lowest model layer) is not considered when defining cloud base height.\nCoefficient of drag with waves\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the resistance that ocean waves exert on the atmosphere. It is sometimes also called a \"friction coefficient\". It is calculated by the wave model as the ratio of the square of the friction velocity, to the square of the neutral wind speed at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state.\nConvective available potential energy\tJ kg-1\tThis is an indication of the instability (or stability) of the atmosphere and can be used to assess the potential for the development of convection, which can lead to heavy rainfall, thunderstorms and other severe weather. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), CAPE is calculated by considering parcels of air departing at different model levels below the 350 hPa level. If a parcel of air is more buoyant (warmer and/or with more moisture) than its surrounding environment, it will continue to rise (cooling as it rises) until it reaches a point where it no longer has positive buoyancy. CAPE is the potential energy represented by the total excess buoyancy. The maximum CAPE produced by the different parcels is the value retained. Large positive values of CAPE indicate that an air parcel would be much warmer than its surrounding environment and therefore, very buoyant. CAPE is related to the maximum potential vertical velocity of air within an updraft; thus, higher values indicate greater potential for severe weather. Observed values in thunderstorm environments often may exceed 1000 joules per kilogram (J kg-1), and in extreme cases may exceed 5000 J kg-1. The calculation of this parameter assumes: (i) the parcel of air does not mix with surrounding air; (ii) ascent is pseudo-adiabatic (all condensed water falls out) and (iii) other simplifications related to the mixed-phase condensational heating.\nConvective inhibition\tJ kg-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the amount of energy required for convection to commence. If the value of this parameter is too high, then deep, moist convection is unlikely to occur even if the convective available potential energy or convective available potential energy shear are large. CIN values greater than 200 J kg-1 would be considered high. An atmospheric layer where temperature increases with height (known as a temperature inversion) would inhibit convective uplift and is a situation in which convective inhibition would be large.\nConvective precipitation\tm\tThis parameter is the accumulated precipitation that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Precipitation can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective rain rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of rainfall (rainfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Rainfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the rainfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective snowfall\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated snow that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Snowfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective snowfall rate water equivalent\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Snowfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the snowfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm thick (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nDownward UV radiation at the surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the surface. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. UV radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the Sun that has wavelengths shorter than visible light. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting system (IFS) it is defined as radiation with a wavelength of 0.20-0.44 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre). Small amounts of UV are essential for living organisms, but overexposure may result in cell damage; in humans this includes acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes and immune system. UV radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer, but some reaches the surface. The depletion of the ozone layer is causing concern over an increase in the damaging effects of UV. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nDuct base height\tm\tDuct base height as diagnosed from vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity.\nEastward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in an eastward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nEastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the eastward (westward) direction. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nEvaporation\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from the Earth's surface, including a simplified representation of transpiration (from vegetation), into vapour in the air above. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate condensation.\nForecast albedo\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by Earth's surface, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. The values of this parameter can range between zero and one. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above, land has intermediate values between about 0.1 and 0.4 and the ocean has low values of 0.1 or less. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The remainder is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The portion that is reflected by the Earth's surface depends on the albedo. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a climatological background albedo (observed values averaged over a period of several years) is used, modified by the model over water, ice and snow. Albedo is often shown as a percentage (%).\nForecast logarithm of surface roughness for heat\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the natural logarithm of the roughness length for heat. The surface roughness for heat is a measure of the surface resistance to heat transfer. This parameter is used to determine the air to surface transfer of heat. For given atmospheric conditions, a higher surface roughness for heat means that it is more difficult for the air to exchange heat with the surface. A lower surface roughness for heat means that it is easier for the air to exchange heat with the surface. Over the ocean, surface roughness for heat depends on the waves. Over sea-ice, it has a constant value of 0.001 m. Over land, it is derived from the vegetation type and snow cover.\nForecast surface roughness\tm\tThis parameter is the aerodynamic roughness length in metres. It is a measure of the surface resistance. This parameter is used to determine the air to surface transfer of momentum. For given atmospheric conditions, a higher surface roughness causes a slower near-surface wind speed. Over ocean, surface roughness depends on the waves. Over land, surface roughness is derived from the vegetation type and snow cover.\nFree convective velocity over the oceans\tm s-1\tThis parameter is an estimate of the vertical velocity of updraughts generated by free convection. Free convection is fluid motion induced by buoyancy forces, which are driven by density gradients. The free convective velocity is used to estimate the impact of wind gusts on ocean wave growth. It is calculated at the height of the lowest temperature inversion (the height above the surface of the Earth where the temperature increases with height). This parameter is one of the parameters used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nFriction velocity\tm s-1\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is a theoretical wind speed at the Earth's surface that expresses the magnitude of stress. It is calculated by dividing the surface stress by air density and taking its square root. For turbulent flow, the friction velocity is approximately constant in the lowest few metres of the atmosphere. This parameter increases with the roughness of the surface. It is used to calculate the way wind changes with height in the lowest levels of the atmosphere.\nGravity wave dissipation\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy in the mean flow, into heat, due to the effects of orographic gravity waves. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nHigh cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThe proportion of a grid box covered by cloud occurring in the high levels of the troposphere. High cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure less than 0.45 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), high cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure of less than 450 hPa (approximately 6km and above (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). The high cloud cover parameter is calculated from cloud for the appropriate model levels as described above. Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.\nHigh vegetation cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box that is covered with vegetation that is classified as \"high\". The values vary between 0 and 1 but do not vary in time. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. \"High vegetation\" consists of evergreen trees, deciduous trees, mixed forest/woodland, and interrupted forest.\nIce temperature layer 1\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 1 (0 to 7cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 2\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 2 (7 to 28cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 3\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 3 (28 to 100cm).

The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 4\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 4 (100 to 150cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nInstantaneous 10m wind gust\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the maximum wind gust at the specified time, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The WMO defines a wind gust as the maximum of the wind averaged over 3 second intervals. This duration is shorter than a model time step, and so the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) deduces the magnitude of a gust within each time step from the time-step-averaged surface stress, surface friction, wind shear and stability. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nInstantaneous eastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface at the specified time in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the eastward (westward) direction.\nInstantaneous large-scale surface precipitation fraction\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box (0-1) covered by large-scale precipitation at the specified time. Large-scale precipitation is rain and snow that falls to the Earth's surface, and is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. Precipitation can also be due to convection generated by the convection scheme in the IFS. The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.\nInstantaneous moisture flux\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the net rate of moisture exchange between the land/ocean surface and the atmosphere, due to the processes of evaporation (including evapotranspiration) and condensation, at the specified time. By convention, downward fluxes are positive, which means that evaporation is represented by negative values and condensation by positive values.\nInstantaneous northward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface at the specified time in the northward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the northward (southward) direction.\nInstantaneous surface sensible heat flux\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the transfer of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, at the specified time, through the effects of turbulent air motion (but excluding any heat transfer resulting from condensation or evaporation). The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nK index\tK\tThis parameter is a measure of the potential for a thunderstorm to develop, calculated from the temperature and dew point temperature in the lower part of the atmosphere. The calculation uses the temperature at 850, 700 and 500 hPa and dewpoint temperature at 850 and 700 hPa. Higher values of K indicate a higher potential for the development of thunderstorms. This parameter is related to the probability of occurrence of a thunderstorm: <20 K No thunderstorm, 20-25 K Isolated thunderstorms, 26-30 K Widely scattered thunderstorms, 31-35 K Scattered thunderstorms, >35 K Numerous thunderstorms.\nLake bottom temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of water at the bottom of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters). In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies. Lake depth and area fraction (cover) are kept constant in time. This parameter has units of kelvin (K).

Mixing can occur when the density of the surface (and near-surface) water is greater than that of the water below. Mixing can also occur through the action of wind on the surface of the water. In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies. Lake depth and area fraction (cover) are kept constant in time. Inland water bodies are represented with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below, where temperature changes with depth. The upper boundary of the thermocline is located at the mixed layer bottom, and the lower boundary of the thermocline at the lake bottom. A single ice layer is used to represent the formation and melting of ice on inland water bodies.\nLake mix-layer temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the uppermost layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters) that is well mixed and has a near constant temperature with depth (i.e., a uniform distribution of temperature with depth).

A single ice layer is used to represent the formation and melting of ice on inland water bodies. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake shape factor\tDimensionless\tThis parameter describes the way that temperature changes with depth in the thermocline layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters) i.e., it describes the shape of the vertical temperature profile. It is used to calculate the lake bottom temperature and other lake-related parameters.

This parameter has values ranging between zero and one and is dimensionless. In cycles of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) from CY41R1 (introduced in May 2015) onwards, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can be comprised of a mixture of land and inland water but not ocean. Grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of a water surface. In the latter case, the lake cover is used to determine how much of the water surface is ocean or inland water. In cycles of the IFS before CY41R1, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can only be comprised of land and those grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of ocean. In these older model cycles, there is no differentiation between ocean and inland water. This parameter does not vary in time.\nLarge scale rain rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of rainfall (rainfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Rainfall can also be generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the rainfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nLarge scale snowfall rate water equivalent\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

Low cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure greater than 0.8 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), low cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure greater than 800 hPa (below approximately 2km (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. This parameter has values from 0 to 1.\nLow vegetation cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box that is covered with vegetation that is classified as \"low\".

This parameter is the magnitude of the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nMaximum individual wave height\tm\tThis parameter is an estimate of the height of the expected highest individual wave within a 20 minute time window. It can be used as a guide to the likelihood of extreme or freak waves. The interactions between waves are non-linear and occasionally concentrate wave energy giving a wave height considerably larger than the significant wave height. If the maximum individual wave height is more than twice the significant wave height, then the wave is considered as a freak wave. The significant wave height represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves, generated by local winds and associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived statistically from the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nMean boundary layer dissipation\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy, into heat, due to small-scale motion in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These small-scale motions are called eddies or turbulence. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean convective precipitation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of precipitation at the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the precipitation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean convective snowfall rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity) at the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the snowfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm thick (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean direction of total swell\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the mean direction of waves associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of all swell only. It is the mean over all frequencies and directions of the total swell spectrum. The units are degrees true which means the direction relative to the geographic location of the north pole. It is the direction that waves are coming FROM, so zero means \"coming from the north\" and 90 \"coming from the east\".\nMean direction of wind waves\tdegrees\tThe mean direction of waves generated by local winds.

It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean eastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution.

This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate condensation.\nMean gravity wave dissipation\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy in the mean flow, into heat, due to the effects of orographic gravity waves. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels.

Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean large-scale snowfall rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity) at the Earth's surface, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

This parameter is the magnitude of the mean stress on the Earth's surface due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean northward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in a northward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System's sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme).

It is the mean over all frequencies and directions of the total wind-sea spectrum.\nMean potential evaporation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the extent to which near-surface atmospheric conditions are conducive to the process of evaporation. It is usually considered to be the amount of evaporation, under existing atmospheric conditions, from a surface of pure water which has the temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere and gives an indication of the maximum possible evaporation. Potential evaporation in the current ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) is based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming \"no stress from soil moisture\". In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although potential evaporation is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean runoff rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil.

This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the runoff would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nMean sea level pressure\tPa\tThis parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere at the surface of the Earth, adjusted to the height of mean sea level. It is a measure of the weight that all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface would have, if the point were located at mean sea level. It is calculated over all surfaces - land, sea and inland water. Maps of mean sea level pressure are used to identify the locations of low and high pressure weather systems, often referred to as cyclones and anticyclones. Contours of mean sea level pressure also indicate the strength of the wind. Tightly packed contours show stronger winds. The units of this parameter are pascals (Pa). Mean sea level pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).\nMean snow evaporation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the average rate of snow evaporation from the snow-covered area of a grid box into vapour in the air above.

This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the snow evaporation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. The IFS convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate deposition.\nMean snowfall rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall at the Earth's surface.

In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting system (IFS) it is defined as radiation with a wavelength of 0.20-0.44 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre). Small amounts of UV are essential for living organisms, but overexposure may result in cell damage; in humans this includes acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes and immune system. UV radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer, but some reaches the surface. The depletion of the ozone layer is causing concern over an increase in the damaging effects of UV.

It is the amount passing through a horizontal plane. Note that the ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards, so a flux from the atmosphere to space will be negative. Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. The thermal radiation emitted to space at the top of the atmosphere is commonly known as the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) (i.e., taking a flux from the atmosphere to space as positive).

The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nMean total precipitation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of precipitation at the Earth's surface. It is the sum of the rates due to large-scale precipitation and convective precipitation. Large-scale precipitation is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Convective precipitation is generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the precipitation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean vertical gradient of refractivity inside trapping layer\tm-1\tMean vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity inside trapping layer.\nMean vertically integrated moisture divergence\tkg m-2 s-1\tThe vertical integral of the moisture flux is the horizontal rate of flow of moisture (water vapour, cloud liquid and cloud ice), per metre across the flow, for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Its horizontal divergence is the rate of moisture spreading outward from a point, per square metre. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. This parameter is positive for moisture that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for moisture that is concentrating, or converging (convergence). This parameter thus indicates whether atmospheric motions act to decrease (for divergence) or increase (for convergence) the vertical integral of moisture, over the time period. High negative values of this parameter (i.e. large moisture convergence) can be related to precipitation intensification and floods. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second.\nMean wave direction\tdegree true\tThis parameter is the mean direction of ocean/sea surface waves. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is a mean over all frequencies and directions of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both. This parameter can be used to assess sea state and swell. For example, engineers use this type of wave information when designing structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.

The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the first swell partition might be from one system at one location and a different system at the neighbouring location). The units are degrees true which means the direction relative to the geographic location of the north pole. It is the direction that waves are coming FROM, so zero means \"coming from the north\" and 90 \"coming from the east\".\nMean wave direction of second swell partition\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the mean direction of waves in the second swell partition. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum).

In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the first swell partition might be from one system at one location and a different system at the neighbouring location). The units are degrees true which means the direction relative to the geographic location of the north pole. It is the direction that waves are coming FROM, so zero means \"coming from the north\" and 90 \"coming from the east\".\nMean wave direction of third swell partition\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the mean direction of waves in the third swell partition. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time.

The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both. This parameter can be used to assess sea state and swell. For example, engineers use such wave information when designing structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nMean wave period based on first moment\ts\tThis parameter is the reciprocal of the mean frequency of the wave components that represent the sea state.

Moments are statistical quantities derived from the two-dimensional wave spectrum.\nMean wave period of first swell partition\ts\tThis parameter is the mean period of waves in the first swell partition. The wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum).

In combination with wave height information, it could be used to assess the length of time that a coastal structure might be under water, for example. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) this parameter is calculated from the characteristics of the two-dimensional wave spectrum.\nMedium cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by cloud occurring in the middle levels of the troposphere. Medium cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure between 0.45 and 0.8 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), medium cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure of less than or equal to 800 hPa and greater than or equal to 450 hPa (between approximately 2km and 6km (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). The medium cloud parameter is calculated from cloud cover for the appropriate model levels as described above. Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.\nMinimum vertical gradient of refractivity inside trapping layer\tm-1\tMinimum vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity inside trapping layer.\nModel bathymetry\tm\tThis parameter is the depth of water from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. It is used by the ocean wave model to specify the propagation properties of the different waves that could be present. Note that the ocean wave model grid is too coarse to resolve some small islands and mountains on the bottom of the ocean, but they can have an impact on surface ocean waves. The ocean wave model has been modified to reduce the wave energy flowing around or over features at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.\nNear IR albedo for diffuse radiation\tDimensionless\tAlbedo is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. This parameter is the fraction of diffuse solar (shortwave) radiation with wavelengths between 0.7 and 4 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre) reflected by the Earth's surface (for snow-free land surfaces only). Values of this parameter vary between 0 and 1. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) albedo is dealt with separately for solar radiation with wavelengths greater/less than 0.7\u00b5m and for direct and diffuse solar radiation (giving 4 components to albedo). Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without being scattered (direct solar radiation). In the IFS, a climatological (observed values averaged over a period of several years) background albedo is used which varies from month to month through the year, modified by the model over water, ice and snow.\nNear IR albedo for direct radiation\tDimensionless\tAlbedo is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. This parameter is the fraction of direct solar (shortwave) radiation with wavelengths between 0.7 and 4 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre) reflected by the Earth's surface (for snow-free land surfaces only). Values of this parameter vary between 0 and 1. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) albedo is dealt with separately for solar radiation with wavelengths greater/less than 0.7\u00b5m and for direct and diffuse solar radiation (giving 4 components to albedo).

In the IFS, a climatological (observed values averaged over a period of several years) background albedo is used which varies from month to month through the year, modified by the model over water, ice and snow.\nNormalized energy flux into ocean\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the normalised vertical flux of turbulent kinetic energy from ocean waves into the ocean. The energy flux is calculated from an estimation of the loss of wave energy due to white capping waves. A white capping wave is one that appears white at its crest as it breaks, due to air being mixed into the water. When waves break in this way, there is a transfer of energy from the waves to the ocean. Such a flux is defined to be negative. The energy flux has units of Watts per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the cube of the friction velocity.\nNormalized energy flux into waves\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the normalised vertical flux of energy from wind into the ocean waves. A positive flux implies a flux into the waves. The energy flux has units of Watts per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the cube of the friction velocity.\nNormalized stress into ocean\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the normalised surface stress, or momentum flux, from the air into the ocean due to turbulence at the air-sea interface and breaking waves. It does not include the flux used to generate waves. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards. The stress has units of Newtons per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the square of the friction velocity.\nNorthward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in a northward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System's sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nNorthward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface in the northward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the northward (southward) direction. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nOcean surface stress equivalent 10m neutral wind direction\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the direction from which the \"neutral wind\" blows, in degrees clockwise from true north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state. This parameter is the wind direction used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model's horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nOcean surface stress equivalent 10m neutral wind speed\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal speed of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The units of this parameter are metres per second. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state. This parameter is the wind speed used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model's horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nOrography\tm2 s-2\tThis parameter is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location at the surface of the Earth, relative to mean sea level and can be referred to as (surface) geopotential. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2 ). This parameter does not vary in time.\nPeak wave period\ts\tThis parameter represents the period of the most energetic ocean waves generated by local winds and associated with swell. The wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is calculated from the reciprocal of the frequency corresponding to the largest value (peak) of the frequency wave spectrum. The frequency wave spectrum is obtained by integrating the two-dimensional wave spectrum over all directions. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nPeriod corresponding to maximum individual wave height\ts\tThis parameter is the period of the expected highest individual wave within a 20-minute time window. It can be used as a guide to the characteristics of extreme or freak waves. Wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. Occasionally waves of different periods reinforce and interact non-linearly giving a wave height considerably larger than the significant wave height. If the maximum individual wave height is more than twice the significant wave height, then the wave is considered to be a freak wave. The significant wave height represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves, generated by local winds and associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived statistically from the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nPotential evaporation\tm\tThis parameter is a measure of the extent to which near-surface atmospheric conditions are conducive to the process of evaporation. It is usually considered to be the amount of evaporation, under existing atmospheric conditions, from a surface of pure water which has the temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere and gives an indication of the maximum possible evaporation. Potential evaporation in the current ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) is based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming \"no stress from soil moisture\". In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although potential evaporation is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours.\nPrecipitation type\tDimensionless\tThis parameter describes the type of precipitation at the surface, at the specified time. A precipitation type is assigned wherever there is a non-zero value of precipitation. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) there are only two predicted precipitation variables: rain and snow. Precipitation type is derived from these two predicted variables in combination with atmospheric conditions, such as temperature. Values of precipitation type defined in the IFS: 0 = No precipitation 1 = Rain 3 = Freezing rain (i.e. supercooled raindrops which freeze on contact with the ground and other surfaces) 5 = Snow 6 = Wet snow (i.e. snow particles which are starting to melt) 7 = Mixture of rain and snow 8 = Ice pellets These precipitation types are consistent with WMO Code Table 4.201. 2 (thunderstorm), 4 (mixed ice), 9 (graupel), 10 (hail), 11 (drizzle) and 12 (freezing drizzle) are not diagnosed in the IFS.\nRunoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is called runoff. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units of runoff are depth in metres of water. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nSea surface temperature\tK\tThis parameter (SST) is the temperature of sea water near the surface. In ERA5, this parameter is a foundation SST, which means there are no variations due to the daily cycle of the sun (diurnal variations). SST, in ERA5, is given by two external providers. Before September 2007, SST from the HadISST2 dataset is used and from September 2007 onwards, the OSTIA dataset is used. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSea-ice cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of a grid box which is covered by sea ice. Sea ice can only occur in a grid box which includes ocean or inland water according to the land sea mask and lake cover, at the resolution being used. This parameter can be known as sea-ice (area) fraction, sea-ice concentration and more generally as sea-ice cover. In ERA5, sea-ice cover is given by two external providers. Before 1979 the HadISST2 dataset is used. From 1979 to August 2007 the OSI SAF (409a) dataset is used and from September 2007 the OSI SAF oper dataset is used. Sea ice is frozen sea water which floats on the surface of the ocean. Sea ice does not include ice which forms on land such as glaciers, icebergs and ice-sheets. It also excludes ice shelves which are anchored on land, but protrude out over the surface of the ocean. These phenomena are not modelled by the IFS. Long-term monitoring of sea ice is important for understanding climate change. Sea ice also affects shipping routes through the polar regions.\nSignificant height of combined wind waves and swell\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves generated by wind and swell. It represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both. More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. This parameter can be used to assess sea state and swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant height of total swell\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with swell. It represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of total swell only. More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional total swell spectrum. The total swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant height of wind waves\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves generated by the local wind.

More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional wind-sea wave spectrum. The wind-sea wave spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are still under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess wind-sea waves. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant wave height of first swell partition\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with the first swell partition. Wave height represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the first might be from one system at one location and another system at the neighbouring location). More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the first swell partition of the two-dimensional swell spectrum. The swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant wave height of second swell partition\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with the second swell partition.

For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSkin reservoir content\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the amount of water in the vegetation canopy and/or in a thin layer on the soil. It represents the amount of rain intercepted by foliage, and water from dew. The maximum amount of \"skin reservoir content\" a grid box can hold depends on the type of vegetation, and may be zero. Water leaves the \"skin reservoir\" by evaporation.\nSkin temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the surface of the Earth. The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes. Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSlope of sub-gridscale orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, angle and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter represents the slope of the sub-grid valleys, hills and mountains. A flat surface has a value of 0, and a 45 degree slope has a value of 0.5. This parameter does not vary in time.\nSnow albedo\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a measure of the reflectivity of the snow-covered part of the grid box. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by snow across the solar spectrum. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. This parameter changes with snow age and also depends on vegetation height. It has a range of values between 0 and 1. For low vegetation, it ranges between 0.52 for old snow and 0.88 for fresh snow. For high vegetation with snow underneath, it depends on vegetation type and has values between 0.27 and 0.38.\nSnow density\tkg m-3\tThis parameter is the mass of snow per cubic metre in the snow layer.

The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow evaporation\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box into vapour in the air above. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. This parameter is the depth of water there would be if the evaporated snow (from the snow-covered area of a grid box) were liquid and were spread evenly over the whole grid box. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The IFS convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate deposition.\nSnowfall\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated snow that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale snowfall and convective snowfall. Large-scale snowfall is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger.

The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nSnowmelt\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has melted from snow in the snow-covered area of a grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.

Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSoil temperature level 2\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the soil at level 2 (in the middle of layer 2).

It is derived from the root zone data (30-100 cm below the surface) of the FAO/UNESCO Digital Soil Map of the World, DSMW (FAO, 2003), which exists at a resolution of 5' X 5' (about 10 km). The seven soil types are: Coarse 1 Medium 2 Medium fine 3 Fine 4 Very fine 5 Organic 6 Tropical organic 7 This parameter does not vary in time.\nStandard deviation of filtered subgrid orography\tm\tClimatological field (scales between approximately 3 and 22 km are included). This parameter does not vary in time.\nStandard deviation of orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being angle of sub-gridscale orography, slope and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter represents the standard deviation of the height of the sub-grid valleys, hills and mountains within a grid box. This parameter does not vary in time.\nSub-surface runoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is called runoff.

Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed.

It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The difference between downward and reflected solar radiation is the surface net solar radiation.

The atmosphere and clouds emit thermal radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface as downward thermal radiation. The upward thermal radiation at the surface consists of thermal radiation emitted by the surface plus the fraction of downwards thermal radiation reflected upward by the surface.

It is a measure of the weight of all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface. Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low and high pressure weather systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this purpose. The units of this parameter are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb= 100 Pa).\nSurface runoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil.

The thermal radiation emitted to space at the top of the atmosphere is commonly known as the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) (i.e., taking a flux from the atmosphere to space as positive).

In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), there is a simplified representation of ozone chemistry (including representation of the chemistry which has caused the ozone hole). Ozone is also transported around in the atmosphere through the motion of air. Naturally occurring ozone in the stratosphere helps protect organisms at the surface of the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Ozone near the surface, often produced because of pollution, is harmful to organisms.

This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the monthly averaged reanalysis and the monthly averaged ensemble members, the accumulation period is 1 day. For the monthly averaged reanalysis by hour of day, the accumulation period is 1 hour and for the monthly averaged ensemble members by hour of day, the accumulation period is 3 hours. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nTotal sky direct solar radiation at surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of direct solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse.

It is a measure of the relative width of the ocean/sea wave frequency spectrum (i.e., whether the ocean/sea wave field is made up of a narrow or broad range of frequencies). The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). When the wave field is more focussed around a narrow range of frequencies, the probability of freak/extreme waves increases. This parameter is Goda's peakedness factor and is used to calculate the Benjamin-Feir Index (BFI). The BFI is in turn used to estimate the probability and nature of extreme/freak waves.\nWave spectral skewness\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a statistical measure used to forecast extreme or freak ocean/sea waves. It describes the nature of the sea surface elevation and how it is affected by waves generated by local winds and associated with swell. Under typical conditions, the sea surface elevation, as described by its probability density function, has a near normal distribution in the statistical sense. However, under certain wave conditions the probability density function of the sea surface elevation can deviate considerably from normality, signalling increased probability of freak waves. This parameter gives one measure of the deviation from normality. It is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability density function of the sea surface elevation. So, a positive/negative skewness (typical range -0.2 to 0.12) means more frequent occurrences of extreme values above/below the mean, relative to a normal distribution.\nZero degree level\tm\tThe height above the Earth's surface where the temperature passes from positive to negative values, corresponding to the top of a warm layer, at the specified time. This parameter can be used to help forecast snow. If more than one warm layer is encountered, then the zero degree level corresponds to the top of the second atmospheric layer. This parameter is set to zero when the temperature in the whole atmosphere is below 0\u2103." ], "Parameters": [ "100m u-component of wind", "100m v-component of wind", "10m u-component of neutral

Although in many other respects the quality of this dataset is quite satisfactory (a document is in preparation), this preliminary data does suffer from tropical cyclones that are sometimes unrealistically intense. This is in contrast with the ERA5 product from 1979 onwards. For more details see the article, ERA5 back extension 1950-1978 (Preliminary version): tropical cyclones are too intense.\n\nAround the end of 2021 an updated version of the back extension is to be made available which will be added to the ERA5 Climate Data Store entries that currently reach back to 1979. After a yet to be determined overlap period the preliminary back extension will be deprecated.\n\nERA5 is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate and weather for the past 4 to 7 decades. Currently data is available from 1950, split into Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension, this page) and from 1979 onwards (final release plus timely updates). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\n\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.

Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines.\n\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves). There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).\n\nThe present entry is \"ERA5 monthly averaged data on pressure levels from 1950 to 1978 (preliminary version)\".\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\tReanalysis: 0.25\u00b0x0.25\u00b0 Ensemble members: 0.5\u00b0x0.5\u00b0\nVertical coverage\t1000 hPa to 1 hPa\nVertical resolution\t37 pressure levels\nTemporal coverage\t1950 to 1978\nTemporal resolution\tMonthly\nFile format\tGRIB\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nDivergence\ts-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal divergence of velocity. It is the rate at which air is spreading out horizontally from a point, per square metre. This parameter is positive for air that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for air that is concentrating, or converging (convergence).\nFraction of cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by cloud (liquid or ice) and varies between zero and one. This parameter is available on multiple levels through the atmosphere.\nGeopotential\tm2 s-2\tThis parameter is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location, relative to mean sea level. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2). The geopotential height plays an important role in synoptic meteorology (analysis of weather patterns). Charts of geopotential height plotted at constant pressure levels (e.g., 300, 500 or 850 hPa) can be used to identify weather systems such as cyclones, anticyclones, troughs and ridges. At the surface of the Earth, this parameter shows the variations in geopotential (height) of the surface, and is often referred to as the orography.\nOzone mass mixing ratio\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of ozone per kilogram of air. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), there is a simplified representation of ozone chemistry (including representation of the chemistry which has caused the ozone hole). Ozone is also transported around in the atmosphere through the motion of air. Naturally occurring ozone in the stratosphere helps protect organisms at the surface of the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Ozone near the surface, often produced because of pollution, is harmful to organisms. Most of the IFS chemical species are archived as mass mixing ratios [kg kg-1].\nPotential vorticity\tK m2 kg-1 s-1\tPotential vorticity is a measure of the capacity for air to rotate in the atmosphere. If we ignore the effects of heating and friction, potential vorticity is conserved following an air parcel. It is used to look for places where large wind storms are likely to originate and develop. Potential vorticity increases strongly above the tropopause and therefore, it can also be used in studies related to the stratosphere and stratosphere-troposphere exchanges. Large wind storms develop when a column of air in the atmosphere starts to rotate. Potential vorticity is calculated from the wind, temperature and pressure across a column of air in the atmosphere.\nRelative humidity\t%\tThis parameter is the water vapour pressure as a percentage of the value at which the air becomes saturated (the point at which water vapour begins to condense into liquid water or deposition into ice). For temperatures over 0\u00b0C (273.15 K) it is calculated for saturation over water. At temperatures below -23\u00b0C it is calculated for saturation over ice. Between -23\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C this parameter is calculated by interpolating between the ice and water values using a quadratic function.\nSpecific cloud ice water content\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of cloud ice particles per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Water within clouds can be liquid or ice, or a combination of the two. Note that 'cloud frozen water' is the same as 'cloud ice water'.\nSpecific cloud liquid water content\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of cloud liquid water droplets per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Water within clouds can be liquid or ice, or a combination of the two.\nSpecific humidity\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of water vapour per kilogram of moist air. The total mass of moist air is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow.\nSpecific rain water content\tkg kg-1\tThe mass of water produced from large-scale clouds that is of raindrop size and so can fall to the surface as precipitation. Large-scale clouds are generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. The quantity is expressed in kilograms per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Clouds contain a continuum of different sized water droplets and ice particles. The IFS cloud scheme simplifies this to represent a number of discrete cloud droplets/particles including cloud water droplets, raindrops, ice crystals and snow (aggregated ice crystals). The processes of droplet formation, phase transition and aggregation are also highly simplified in the IFS.\nSpecific snow water content\tkg kg-1\tThe mass of snow (aggregated ice crystals) produced from large-scale clouds that can fall to the surface as precipitation. Large-scale clouds are generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger.

The IFS cloud scheme simplifies this to represent a number of discrete cloud droplets/particles including cloud water droplets, raindrops, ice crystals and snow (aggregated ice crystals). The processes of droplet formation, phase transition and aggregation are also highly simplified in the IFS.\nTemperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature in the atmosphere. It has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15. This parameter is available on multiple levels through the atmosphere.\nU-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east. A negative sign indicates air moving towards the west.\nV-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north. A negative sign indicates air moving towards the south.\nVertical velocity\tPa s-1\tThis parameter is the speed of air motion in the upward or downward direction. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) uses a pressure based vertical co-ordinate system and pressure decreases with height, therefore negative values of vertical velocity indicate upward motion. Vertical velocity can be useful to understand the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere, including areas of upward motion/ascent (negative values) and downward motion/subsidence (positive values).\nVorticity (relative)\ts-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the rotation of air in the horizontal, around a vertical axis, relative to a fixed point on the surface of the Earth. On the scale of weather systems, troughs (weather features that can include rain) are associated with anticlockwise rotation (in the northern hemisphere), and ridges (weather features that bring light or still winds) are associated with clockwise rotation. Adding the effect of rotation of the Earth, the Coriolis parameter, to the relative vorticity produces the absolute vorticity." ], "Parameters": [ "Divergence", "Fraction of cloud cover", "Geopotential", "Ozone mass mixing ratio", "Potential vorticity", "Relative humidity", "Specific cloud ice water content", "Specific cloud liquid water content", "Specific humidity", "Specific rain water content", "Specific snow water content", "Temperature", "U-component of wind", "V-component of wind", "Vertical velocity", "Vorticity (relative)" ] }

This parameter can be combined with the V component of wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal wind.\nV-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north. A negative sign indicates air moving towards the south. This parameter can be combined with the U component of wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal wind.\nVertical velocity\tPa s-1\tThis parameter is the speed of air motion in the upward or downward direction. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) uses a pressure based vertical co-ordinate system and pressure decreases with height, therefore negative values of vertical velocity indicate upward motion. Vertical velocity can be useful to understand the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere, including areas of upward motion/ascent (negative values) and downward motion/subsidence (positive values).\nVorticity (relative)\ts-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the rotation of air in the horizontal, around a vertical axis, relative to a fixed point on the surface of the Earth. On the scale of weather systems, troughs (weather features that can include rain) are associated with anticlockwise rotation (in the northern hemisphere), and ridges (weather features that bring light or still winds) are associated with clockwise rotation.

Currently data is available from 1950, split into Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension) and from 1979 onwards (final release plus timely updates, this page). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\n\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\n\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days (monthly means are available around the 6th of each month). In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. So far this has not been the case and when this does occur users will be notified.\n\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\n\nAn overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article. Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines.\n\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves). There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).\n\nThe present entry is \"ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels from 1979 to present\".\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tRegular latitude-longitude grid.\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\tReanalysis: 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0 Ensemble members: 0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0\nVertical coverage\t1000 hPa to 1 hPa\nVertical resolution\t37 pressure levels\nTemporal coverage\t1979 to present\nTemporal resolution\tMonthly\nFile format\tGRIB\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nDivergence\ts-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal divergence of velocity. It is the rate at which air is spreading out horizontally from a point, per square metre. This parameter is positive for air that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for air that is concentrating, or converging (convergence).\nFraction of cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by cloud (liquid or ice) and varies between zero and one. This parameter is available on multiple levels through the atmosphere.\nGeopotential\tm2 s-2\tThis parameter is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location, relative to mean sea level. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2). The geopotential height plays an important role in synoptic meteorology (analysis of weather patterns). Charts of geopotential height plotted at constant pressure levels (e.g., 300, 500 or 850 hPa) can be used to identify weather systems such as cyclones, anticyclones, troughs and ridges. At the surface of the Earth, this parameter shows the variations in geopotential (height) of the surface, and is often referred to as the orography.\nOzone mass mixing ratio\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of ozone per kilogram of air. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), there is a simplified representation of ozone chemistry (including representation of the chemistry which has caused the ozone hole). Ozone is also transported around in the atmosphere through the motion of air. Naturally occurring ozone in the stratosphere helps protect organisms at the surface of the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Ozone near the surface, often produced because of pollution, is harmful to organisms. Most of the IFS chemical species are archived as mass mixing ratios [kg kg-1].\nPotential vorticity\tK m2 kg-1 s-1\tPotential vorticity is a measure of the capacity for air to rotate in the atmosphere. If we ignore the effects of heating and friction, potential vorticity is conserved following an air parcel. It is used to look for places where large wind storms are likely to originate and develop. Potential vorticity increases strongly above the tropopause and therefore, it can also be used in studies related to the stratosphere and stratosphere-troposphere exchanges. Large wind storms develop when a column of air in the atmosphere starts to rotate. Potential vorticity is calculated from the wind, temperature and pressure across a column of air in the atmosphere.\nRelative humidity\t%\tThis parameter is the water vapour pressure as a percentage of the value at which the air becomes saturated (the point at which water vapour begins to condense into liquid water or deposition into ice). For temperatures over 0\u00b0C (273.15 K) it is calculated for saturation over water. At temperatures below -23\u00b0C it is calculated for saturation over ice. Between -23\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C this parameter is calculated by interpolating between the ice and water values using a quadratic function.\nSpecific cloud ice water content\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of cloud ice particles per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Water within clouds can be liquid or ice, or a combination of the two. Note that 'cloud frozen water' is the same as 'cloud ice water'.\nSpecific cloud liquid water content\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of cloud liquid water droplets per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Water within clouds can be liquid or ice, or a combination of the two.\nSpecific humidity\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of water vapour per kilogram of moist air. The total mass of moist air is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow.\nSpecific rain water content\tkg kg-1\tThe mass of water produced from large-scale clouds that is of raindrop size and so can fall to the surface as precipitation. Large-scale clouds are generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. The quantity is expressed in kilograms per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Clouds contain a continuum of different sized water droplets and ice particles. The IFS cloud scheme simplifies this to represent a number of discrete cloud droplets/particles including cloud water droplets, raindrops, ice crystals and snow (aggregated ice crystals). The processes of droplet formation, phase transition and aggregation are also highly simplified in the IFS.\nSpecific snow water content\tkg kg-1\tThe mass of snow (aggregated ice crystals) produced from large-scale clouds that can fall to the surface as precipitation. Large-scale clouds are generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger.

The IFS cloud scheme simplifies this to represent a number of discrete cloud droplets/particles including cloud water droplets, raindrops, ice crystals and snow (aggregated ice crystals). The processes of droplet formation, phase transition and aggregation are also highly simplified in the IFS.\nTemperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature in the atmosphere. It has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15. This parameter is available on multiple levels through the atmosphere.\nU-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east. A negative sign indicates air moving towards the west.\nV-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north. A negative sign indicates air moving towards the south.\nVertical velocity\tPa s-1\tThis parameter is the speed of air motion in the upward or downward direction. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) uses a pressure based vertical co-ordinate system and pressure decreases with height, therefore negative values of vertical velocity indicate upward motion. Vertical velocity can be useful to understand the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere, including areas of upward motion/ascent (negative values) and downward motion/subsidence (positive values).\nVorticity (relative)\ts-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the rotation of air in the horizontal, around a vertical axis, relative to a fixed point on the surface of the Earth. On the scale of weather systems, troughs (weather features that can include rain) are associated with anticlockwise rotation (in the northern hemisphere), and ridges (weather features that bring light or still winds) are associated with clockwise rotation.

ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past. \nERA5-Land uses as input to control the simulated land fields ERA5 atmospheric variables, such as air temperature and air humidity. This is called the atmospheric forcing. Without the constraint of the atmospheric forcing, the model-based estimates can rapidly deviate from reality. Therefore, while observations are not directly used in the production of ERA5-Land, they have an indirect influence through the atmospheric forcing used to run the simulation. In addition, the input air temperature, air humidity and pressure used to run ERA5-Land are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of ERA5-Land. This correction is called 'lapse rate correction'.    \nThe ERA5-Land dataset, as any other simulation, provides estimates which have some degree of uncertainty. Numerical models can only provide a more or less accurate representation of the real physical processes governing different components of the Earth System. In general, the uncertainty of model estimates grows as we go back in time, because the number of observations available to create a good quality atmospheric forcing is lower. ERA5-land parameter fields can currently be used in combination with the uncertainty of the equivalent ERA5 fields. \nThe temporal and spatial resolutions of ERA5-Land makes this dataset very useful for all kind of land surface applications such as flood or drought forecasting. The temporal and spatial resolution of this dataset, the period covered in time, as well as the fixed grid used for the data distribution at any period enables decisions makers, businesses and individuals to access and use more accurate information on land states.\n         \n         \n        \n        \n        DATA DESCRIPTION\n        \nData typeGridded\nProjectionRegular latitude-longitude grid\nHorizontal coverageGlobal\nHorizontal resolution0.1\u00b0 x 0.1\u00b0; Native resolution is 9 km.\nVertical coverageFrom 2 m above the surface level, to a soil depth of 289 cm.\nVertical resolution4 levels of the ECMWF surface model: Layer 1: 0 -7cm, Layer 2: 7 -28cm, Layer 3: 28-100cm, Layer 4: 100-289cm \nSome parameters are defined at 2 m over the surface. \nTemporal coverageJanuary 1981 to present\nTemporal resolutionHourly\nFile formatGRIB\nUpdate frequencyMonthly with a delay of about three months relatively to actual date.\n\n\n    \n    \n    MAIN VARIABLES\n    \n\n    NameUnitsDescription\n    \n10m u-component of windm s-1Eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this variable with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. This variable can be combined with the V component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.\n10m v-component of windm s-1Northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this variable with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. This variable can be combined with the U component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.\n2m dewpoint temperatureKTemperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur.It is a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature and pressure, it can be used to calculate the relative humidity. 2m dew point temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\n2m temperatureKTemperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or in-land waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions.  Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nEvaporation from bare soilm of water equivalentThe amount of evaporation from bare soil at the top of the land surface. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nEvaporation from open water surfaces excluding oceansm of water equivalentAmount of evaporation from surface water storage like lakes and inundated areas but excluding oceans.  This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nEvaporation from the top of canopym of water equivalentThe amount of evaporation from the canopy interception reservoir at the top of the canopy. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nEvaporation from vegetation transpirationm of water equivalentAmount of evaporation from vegetation transpiration. This has the same meaning as root extraction i.e. the amount of water extracted from the different soil layers. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nForecast albedodimensionlessIs a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by Earth's surface, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. Values are between  0 and 1. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above, land has intermediate values between about 0.1 and 0.4 and the ocean has low values of 0.1 or less. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The portion that is reflected by the Earth's surface depends on the albedo. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a climatological background albedo (observed values averaged over a period of several years) is used, modified by the model over water, ice and snow. Albedo is often shown as a percentage (%).\nLake bottom temperatureKTemperature of water at the bottom of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers) and coastal waters. ECMWF implemented a lake model in May 2015 to  represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world\u2019s major inland  water bodies in the Integrated Forecasting System. The model keeps lake depth and surface area (or fractional cover) constant in time. \nLake ice depthmThe thickness of ice on inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers) and  coastal waters. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents the formation and melting of ice on inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers)  and coastal water. A single ice layer is represented. This parameter is the thickness of that ice layer.\nLake ice temperatureKThe temperature of the uppermost surface of ice on inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers) and coastal waters. The ECMWF Integrated  Forecasting System represents the formation and melting of ice on lakes.  A single ice layer is represented. The temperature measured in kelvin can  be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake mix-layer depthmThe thickness of the upper most layer of an inland water body (lake, reservoirs, and rivers) or coastal waters that is well mixed and has a near constant temperature with depth (uniform distribution of temperature).  The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System represents inland water bodies with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below. Thermoclines upper boundary is located at the mixed layer bottom, and the lower boundary at the lake bottom. Mixing within the mixed layer can occur when the density of the surface (and near-surface) water is greater than that of the water below. Mixing can also occur through  the action of wind on the surface of the lake. \nLake mix-layer temperatureKThe temperature of the upper most layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers) or coastal waters) that is well mixed. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System  represents inland water bodies with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer  above and the thermocline below. Thermoclines upper boundary is located at the mixed layer bottom, and the lower boundary at the lake bottom. Mixing within the mixed layer can occur when the  density of the surface (and near-surface) water is greater than that of the water  below. Mixing can also occur through the action of wind on the surface of the lake. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake shape factordimensionlessThis parameter describes the way that temperature changes with depth in the  thermocline layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers) and coastal  waters. It is used to calculate the lake bottom temperature and other lake-related  parameters. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System represents inland and coastal water bodies  with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below  where temperature changes with depth.\nLake total layer temperatureKThe mean temperature of total water column in inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers)  and coastal waters. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System represents inland  water bodies with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the  thermocline below where temperature changes with depth. This parameter is  the mean over the two layers. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted  to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLeaf area index, high vegetationm2 m-2One-half of the total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for high vegetation type. \nLeaf area index, low vegetationm2 m-2One-half of the total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for low vegetation type. \nPotential evaporationmPotential evaporation (pev) in the current ECMWF model is computed, by making a second call to the surface energy balance routine with the vegetation variables set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming no stress from soil moisture. In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although pev is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nRunoffmSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area.  Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.\nSkin reservoir contentm of water equivalentAmount of water in the vegetation canopy and/or in a thin layer on the soil. It represents the amount of rain intercepted by foliage, and water from dew. The maximum amount of 'skin reservoir content' a grid box can hold depends on the type of vegetation, and may be zero.  Water leaves the 'skin reservoir' by evaporation. \nSkin temperatureKTemperature of the surface of the Earth. The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes. Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea.  Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15. \nSnow albedodimensionlessIt is defined as the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by the snow, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. It is a measure of the reflectivity of the snow covered grid cells. Values vary between 0 and 1. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above.\nSnow cover%It represents the fraction (0-1) of the cell / grid-box occupied by snow (similar to the cloud cover fields of ERA5).\nSnow densitykg m-3Mass of snow per cubic metre in the snow layer. The ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. \nSnow depthmInstantaneous grib-box average of the snow thickness on the ground (excluding snow on canopy).\nSnow depth water equivalentm of water equivalentDepth of snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box. Its units are metres of water equivalent, so it is the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the whole grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecast System represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow evaporationm of water equivalentEvaporation from snow averaged over the grid box (to find flux over snow, divide by snow fraction). This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast  time to the end of the forecast step. \nSnowfallm of water equivalentAccumulated total snow that has fallen to the Earth's surface. It consists of snow due to the large-scale atmospheric flow (horizontal scales greater than around a few hundred metres) and convection where smaller scale areas (around 5km to a few hundred kilometres) of warm air rise. If snow has melted during the period over which this variable was accumulated, then it will be higher than the snow depth. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.  The units given measure the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step.\nSnowmeltm of water equivalentMelting of snow averaged over the grid box (to find melt over snow, divide by snow fraction). This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nSoil temperature level 1KTemperature of the soil in layer 1 (0 - 7 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. The surface is at 0 cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer.  Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15. \nSoil temperature level 2KTemperature of the soil in layer 2 (7 -28cm) of the ECMWF Integrated  Forecasting System. \nSoil temperature level 3KTemperature of the soil in layer 3 (28-100cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\nSoil temperature level 4KTemperature of the soil in layer 4 (100-289 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\nSub-surface runoffmSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.  The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area.  Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.\nSurface latent heat fluxJ m-2Exchange of latent heat with the surface through turbulent diffusion. This variables is  accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. By model convention, downward fluxes are positive. \nSurface net solar radiationJ m-2Amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth (both direct and diffuse) minus the amount reflected by the Earth's surface (which is governed by the albedo).Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The difference between downward and reflected solar radiation is the surface net solar radiation. This variable is accumulated  from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface net thermal radiationJ m-2Net thermal radiation at the surface. Accumulated field from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.  By model convention downward fluxes are positive.\nSurface pressurePaPressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere on the surface of land, sea and in-land water. It is a measure of the weight of all the air in a column vertically above the area of the Earth's surface represented at a fixed point. Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low and high pressure systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this purpose. The units of this variable are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).\nSurface runoffmSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.\nSurface sensible heat fluxJ m-2Transfer of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere through the effects of turbulent air motion (but excluding any heat transfer resulting from condensation or evaporation). The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere.  This is a single level variable and it is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface solar radiation downwardsJ m-2Amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth. This variable comprises both direct and diffuse solar radiation. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed.  The rest is incident on the Earth's surface (represented by this variable). To a reasonably good approximation, this variable is the model equivalent of what would be measured by a pyranometer (an instrument used for measuring solar radiation) at the surface. However, care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a  model grid box and model time step. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface thermal radiation downwardsJ m-2Amount of thermal (also known as longwave or terrestrial) radiation emitted by the atmosphere and clouds that reaches the Earth's surface. The surface of the Earth emits thermal radiation, some of which is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. The atmosphere and clouds likewise emit thermal radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface (represented by this variable). This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nTemperature of snow layerKThis variable gives the temperature of the snow layer from the ground to the snow-air interface. The ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the  grid box.  Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nTotal evaporationm of water equivalentAccumulated amount of water that has evaporated from the Earth's surface, including a simplified representation of transpiration (from vegetation), into vapour in the air above. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast to the end of the forecast step. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate condensation.\nTotal precipitationmAccumulated liquid and frozen water, including rain and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale precipitation (that precipitation which is generated by large-scale weather patterns, such as troughs and cold fronts) and convective precipitation (generated by convection which occurs when air at lower levels in the atmosphere is warmer and less dense than the air above, so it rises). Precipitation variables do not include fog, dew or the precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before it lands at the surface of the Earth. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of precipitation are depth in metres. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and  model time step.\nVolumetric soil water layer 1m3 m-3Volume of water in soil layer 1 (0 - 7 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. The surface is at 0 cm. The volumetric soil water is associated with the soil texture (or classification), soil depth, and the underlying groundwater level.\nVolumetric soil water layer 2m3 m-3Volume of water in soil layer 2 (7 -28 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. \nVolumetric soil water layer 3m3 m-3Volume of water in soil layer 3 (28-100 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\nVolumetric soil water layer 4m3 m-3Volume of water in soil layer 4 (100-289 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\n\n    " ], "Parameters": [ "10m u-component of wind", "10m v-component of wind", "2m dewpoint temperature", "2m temperature", "Evaporation from bare soil", "Evaporation from open water surfaces excluding oceans", "Evaporation from the top of canopy", "Evaporation from vegetation transpiration", "Forecast albedo", "Lake bottom temperature", "Lake ice depth", "Lake ice temperature", "Lake mix-layer depth", "Lake mix-layer temperature", "Lake shape factor", "Lake total layer temperature", "Leaf area index, high vegetation", "Leaf area index, low vegetation", "Potential evaporation", "Runoff", "Skin reservoir content", "Skin temperature", "Snow albedo", "Snow cover", "Snow density", "Snow depth", "Snow depth water equivalent", "Snow evaporation", "Snowfall", "Snowmelt", "Soil temperature level 1", "Soil temperature level 2", "Soil temperature level 3", "Soil temperature level 4", "Sub-surface runoff", "Surface latent heat flux", "Surface net solar radiation", "Surface net thermal radiation", "Surface pressure", "Surface runoff", "Surface sensible heat flux", "Surface solar radiation downwards", "Surface thermal radiation downwards", "Temperature of snow layer", "Total evaporation", "Total precipitation", "Volumetric soil water layer 1", "Volumetric soil water layer 2", "Volumetric soil water layer 3", "Volumetric soil water layer 4" ] }

The fire danger metrics provided are part of a vast dataset produced by the Copernicus Emergency Management Service for the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). The European Forest Fire Information System incorporates the fire danger indices for three different models developed in Canada, United States and Australia. In this dataset the fire danger indices are calculated using weather forecast from historical simulations provided by ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis.\n\nERA5 by combining model data and a vast set of quality controlled observations provides a globally complete and consistent data-set and is regarded as a good proxy for observed atmospheric conditions.\n\nThe selected data records in this data set are regularly extended with time as ERA5 forcing data become available.\n\nThis dataset is produced by ECMWF in its role of the computational centre for fire danger forecast of the CEMS, on behalf of the Joint Research Centre which is the managing entity of the service.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tRegular latitude-longitude grid\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal Land\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\nReanalysis: 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0\n\nMean, spread and members: 0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0\n\n\nTemporal coverage\t1979 to present\nTemporal resolution\tDaily\nFile format\tNetCDF\nUpdate frequency\tMonthly\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nBuild-up index\tDimensionless\tThe Build-Up Index is a weighted combination of the Duff moisture code and Drought code to indicate the total amount of fuel available for combustion by a moving flame front. The Duff moisture code has the most influence on the Build-up index value. For example, a Duff moisture code value of zero always results in a Build-up index value of zero regardless of what the Drought code value is. The Drought code has the strongest influence on the Build-up index when Duff moisture code values are high. The greatest effect that the Drought code can have is to make the Build-up index value equal to twice the Duff moisture code value. The Build-up index is often used for pre-suppression planning purposes.\nBurning index\t10ft\tThe Burning Index measures the difficulty of controlling a fire. It is derived from a combination of Spread component (how fast it will spread) and Energy release component (how much energy will be produced). In this way, it is related to flame length, which, in the Fire Behavior Prediction System, is based on rate of spread and heat per unit area. However, because of differences in the calculations for Burning index and flame length, they are not the same.\nDanger rating\tDimensionless\tThe Danger rating is equivalent to the FWI reduced to 6 classes of danger, accordingly to EFFIS danger class levels definition (very low, low, medium, high, very high and extreme). The fire danger classes are the same for all countries so maps show a harmonized picture of the spatial distribution of fire danger level.\nDrought code\tDimensionless\tThe Drought code is an indicator of the moisture content in deep compact organic layers. This code represents a fuel layer at approximately 10-20 cm deep. The Drought code fuels have a very slow drying rate, with a time lag of 52 days. The Drought code scale is open-ended, although the maximum value is about 800.\nDuff moisture code\tDimensionless\tThe Duff moisture code is an indicatore of the moisture content in loosely-compacted organic layers of moderate depth. It is representative of the duff layer that is 5-10 cm deep. Duff moisture code fuels are affected by rain, temperature and relative humidity. Because these fuels are below the forest floor surface, wind speed does not affect the fuel moisture content. The Duff moisture code fuels have a slower drying rate than the Fine fuel moisture code fuels, with a timelag of 12 days. Although the Duff moisture code has an open-ended scale, the highest probable value is in the range of 150.\nEnergy release component\t25Btu ft2 -1\tThe Energy release component is a number related to the available energy (British Thermal Unit) per unit area (square foot) within the flaming front at the head of a fire. Daily variations in Energy release component are due to changes in moisture content of the various fuels present, both live and dead. Since this number represents the potential \"heat release\" per unit area in the flaming zone, it can provide guidance to several important fire activities. It may also be considered a composite fuel moisture value as it reflects the contribution that all live and dead fuels have to potential fire intensity. The Energy release component is a cumulative or \"build-up\" type of index. As live fuels cure and dead fuels dry, the Energy release component values get higher thus providing a good reflection of drought conditions. The scale is open-ended or unlimited and, as with other National Forest Danger Rating System components, is relative.\nFine fuel moisture code\tDimensionless\tThe Fine fuel moisture code is an indicatore of the moisture content in litter and other cured fine fuels (needles, mosses, twigs less than 1 cm in diameter). The Fine fuel moisture code is representative of the top litter layer less than 1-2 cm deep. Fine fuel moisture code values change rapidly because of a high surface area to volume ratio, and direct exposure to changing environmental conditions. The Fine fuel moisture code scale ranges from 0-99 and is the only component of the Fire weather index system which does not have an open-ended scale. Generally, fires begin to ignite at Fine fuel moisture code values near 70, and the maximum probable value that will ever be achieved is 96.\nFire daily severity index\tDimensionless\tNumeric rating of the difficulty of controlling fires. It is an exponential transformation of the Fire weather index and more accurately reflects the expected efforts required for fire suppression as it increases exponentially as the Fire weather index is above a certain value.\nFire danger index\tDimensionless\tThe Fire danger index is a metric related to the chances of a fire starting, its rate of spread, its intensity, and its difficulty of suppression. It is open ended however a value of 50 and above is considered extreme in most vegetation\nFire weather index\tDimensionless\tThe Fire weather index is a combination of Initial spread index and Build-up index, and is a numerical rating of the potential frontal fire intensity. In effect, it indicates fire intensity by combining the rate of fire spread with the amount of fuel being consumed. Fire weather index values are not upper bounded however a value of 50 is considered as extreme in many places. The Fire weather index is used for general public information about fire danger conditions.\nIgnition component\t%\tThe Ignition component measures the probability a firebrand will require suppression action. Since it is expressed as a probability, it ranges on a scale of 0 to 100. An Ignition component of 100 means that every firebrand will cause a fire requiring action if it contacts a receptive fuel. Likewise an Ignition component of 0 would mean that no firebrand would cause a fire requiring suppression action under those conditions.\nInitial spread index\tDimensionless\tThe Initial spread index combines the Fine fuel moisture code and wind speed to indicate the expected rate of fire spread. Generally, a 13 km h-1 increase in wind speed will double the Initial spread index value. The Initial spread index is accepted as a good indicator of fire spread in open light fuel stands with wind speeds up to 40 km h-1.\nKeetch-Byram drought index\tDimensionless\t\n\nThe Keetch-Byram drought index (KBDI) is a number representing the net effect of evapotranspiration and precipitation in producing cumulative moisture deficiency in deep duff and upper soil layers. It is a continuous index, relating to the flammability of organic material in the ground.The Keetch-Byram drought index attempts to measure the amount of precipitation necessary to return the soil to saturated conditions. It is a closed system ranging from 0 to 200 units and represents a moisture regime from 0 to 20 cm of water through the soil layer. At 20 cm of water, the Keetch-Byram drought index assumes saturation. Zero is the point of no moisture deficiency and 200 is the maximum drought that is possible. At any point along the scale, the index number indicates the amount of net rainfall that is required to reduce the index to zero, or saturation.\n\nThe inputs for Keetch-Byram drought index are weather station latitude, mean annual precipitation, maximum dry bulb temperature, and the last 24 hours of rainfall. Reduction in drought occurs only when rainfall exceeds 5 mm (called net rainfall). The computational steps involve reducing the drought index by the net rain amount and increasing the drought index by a drought factor.\n\nKBDI = 0 - 50: Soil moisture and large class fuel moistures are high and do not contribute much to fire intensity. Typical of spring dormant season following winter precipitation.\n\nKBDI = 50 - 100: Typical of late spring, early growing season. Lower litter and duff layers are drying and beginning to contribute to fire intensity.\n\nKBDI = 100 - 150: Typical of late summer, early fall. Lower litter and duff layers actively contribute to fire intensity and will burn actively.\n\nKBDI = 150 - 200: Often associated with more severe drought with increased wildfire occurrence. Intense, deep burning fires with significant downwind spotting can be expected. Live fuels can also be expected to burn actively at these levels.\n\n\nSpread component\tDimensionless\tThe Spread component is a measure of the spead at which a headfire would spread. The spread component is numerically equal to the theoretical ideal rate of spread expressed in feet-per-minute however is considered as a dimensionless variable. The Spread component is expressed on an open-ended scale; thus it has no upper limit." ], "Parameters": [ "Build-up index", "Burning index", "Danger rating", "Drought code", "Duff moisture code", "Energy release component", "Fine fuel moisture code", "Fire daily severity index", "Fire danger index", "Fire weather index", "Ignition component", "Initial spread index", "Keetch-Byram drought index", "Spread component" ] }

It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this variable with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. This variable can be combined with the V component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.\n10m v-component of wind\tm s-1\tNorthward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this variable with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. This variable can be combined with the U component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.\n2m dewpoint temperature\tK\tTemperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur.It is a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature and pressure, it can be used to calculate the relative humidity. 2m dew point temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\n2m temperature\tK\tTemperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or in-land waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nEvaporation\tm of water equivalent\tAccumulated amount of water that has evaporated from the Earth's surface, including a simplified representation of transpiration (from vegetation), into vapour in the air above. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast to the end of the forecast step. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate condensation.\nEvaporation from bare soil\tm of water equivalent\tThe amount of evaporation from bare soil at the top of the land surface. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nEvaporation from open water surfaces excluding oceans\tm of water equivalent\tAmount of evaporation from surface water storage like lakes and inundated areas but excluding oceans. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nEvaporation from the top of canopy\tm of water equivalent\tThe amount of evaporation from the canopy interception reservoir at the top of the canopy. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nEvaporation from vegetation transpiration\tm of water equivalent\tAmount of evaporation from vegetation transpiration. This has the same meaning as root extraction i.e. the amount of water extracted from the different soil layers. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nForecast albedo\tdimensionless\tIs a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by Earth's surface, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. Values are between 0 and 1. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above, land has intermediate values between about 0.1 and 0.4 and the ocean has low values of 0.1 or less. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The portion that is reflected by the Earth's surface depends on the albedo. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a climatological background albedo (observed values averaged over a period of several years) is used, modified by the model over water, ice and snow. Albedo is often shown as a percentage (%).\nLake bottom temperature\tK\tTemperature of water at the bottom of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers) and coastal waters. ECMWF implemented a lake model in May 2015 to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world\u2019s major inland water bodies in the Integrated Forecasting System. The model keeps lake depth and surface area (or fractional cover) constant in time.\nLake ice depth\tm\tThe thickness of ice on inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers) and coastal waters. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents the formation and melting of ice on inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers) and coastal water. A single ice layer is represented. This parameter is the thickness of that ice layer.\nLake ice temperature\tK\tThe temperature of the uppermost surface of ice on inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers) and coastal waters. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System represents the formation and melting of ice on lakes. A single ice layer is represented. The temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake mix-layer depth\tm\tThe thickness of the upper most layer of an inland water body (lake, reservoirs, and rivers) or coastal waters that is well mixed and has a near constant temperature with depth (uniform distribution of temperature). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System represents inland water bodies with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below. Thermoclines upper boundary is located at the mixed layer bottom, and the lower boundary at the lake bottom. Mixing within the mixed layer can occur when the density of the surface (and near-surface) water is greater than that of the water below. Mixing can also occur through the action of wind on the surface of the lake.\nLake mix-layer temperature\tK\tThe temperature of the upper most layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers) or coastal waters) that is well mixed. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System represents inland water bodies with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below. Thermoclines upper boundary is located at the mixed layer bottom, and the lower boundary at the lake bottom. Mixing within the mixed layer can occur when the density of the surface (and near-surface) water is greater than that of the water below. Mixing can also occur through the action of wind on the surface of the lake. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLake shape factor\tdimensionless\tThis parameter describes the way that temperature changes with depth in the thermocline layer of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers) and coastal waters. It is used to calculate the lake bottom temperature and other lake-related parameters. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System represents inland and coastal water bodies with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below where temperature changes with depth.\nLake total layer temperature\tK\tThe mean temperature of total water column in inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs and rivers) and coastal waters. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System represents inland water bodies with two layers in the vertical, the mixed layer above and the thermocline below where temperature changes with depth. This parameter is the mean over the two layers. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nLeaf area index, high vegetation\tm2 m-2\tOne-half of the total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for high vegetation type.\nLeaf area index, low vegetation\tm2 m-2\tOne-half of the total green leaf area per unit horizontal ground surface area for low vegetation type.\nPotential evaporation\tm\tPotential evaporation (pev) in the current ECMWF model is computed, by making a second call to the surface energy balance routine with the vegetation variables set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming no stress from soil moisture. In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although pev is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nRunoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.\nSkin reservoir content\tm of water equivalent\tAmount of water in the vegetation canopy and/or in a thin layer on the soil. It represents the amount of rain intercepted by foliage, and water from dew. The maximum amount of 'skin reservoir content' a grid box can hold depends on the type of vegetation, and may be zero. Water leaves the 'skin reservoir' by evaporation.\nSkin temperature\tK\tTemperature of the surface of the Earth. The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes. Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSnow albedo\tdimensionless\tIt is defined as the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by the snow, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. It is a measure of the reflectivity of the snow covered grid cells. Values vary between 0 and 1. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above.\nSnow cover\t%\tIt represents the fraction (0-1) of the cell / grid-box occupied by snow (similar to the cloud cover fields of ERA5).\nSnow density\tkg m-3\tMass of snow per cubic metre in the snow layer. The ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow depth\tm\tInstantaneous grib-box average of the snow thickness on the ground (excluding snow on canopy).\nSnow depth water equivalent\tm of water equivalent\tDepth of snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box. Its units are metres of water equivalent, so it is the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the whole grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecast System represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow evaporation\tm of water equivalent\tEvaporation from snow averaged over the grid box (to find flux over snow, divide by snow fraction). This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nSnowfall\tm of water equivalent\tAccumulated total snow that has fallen to the Earth's surface. It consists of snow due to the large-scale atmospheric flow (horizontal scales greater than around a few hundred metres) and convection where smaller scale areas (around 5km to a few hundred kilometres) of warm air rise. If snow has melted during the period over which this variable was accumulated, then it will be higher than the snow depth. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units given measure the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step.\nSnowmelt\tm of water equivalent\tMelting of snow averaged over the grid box (to find melt over snow, divide by snow fraction). This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step.\nSoil temperature level 1\tK\tTemperature of the soil in layer 1 (0 - 7 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. The surface is at 0 cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSoil temperature level 2\tK\tTemperature of the soil in layer 2 (7 -28cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\nSoil temperature level 3\tK\tTemperature of the soil in layer 3 (28-100cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\nSoil temperature level 4\tK\tTemperature of the soil in layer 4 (100-289 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\nSub-surface runoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.\nSurface latent heat flux\tJ m-2\tExchange of latent heat with the surface through turbulent diffusion. This variables is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. By model convention, downward fluxes are positive.\nSurface net solar radiation\tJ m-2\tAmount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth (both direct and diffuse) minus the amount reflected by the Earth's surface (which is governed by the albedo).Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The difference between downward and reflected solar radiation is the surface net solar radiation. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface net thermal radiation\tJ m-2\tNet thermal radiation at the surface. Accumulated field from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. By model convention downward fluxes are positive.\nSurface pressure\tPa\tPressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere on the surface of land, sea and in-land water. It is a measure of the weight of all the air in a column vertically above the area of the Earth's surface represented at a fixed point. Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low and high pressure systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this purpose. The units of this variable are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).\nSurface runoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is simply called 'runoff'. This variable is the total amount of water accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes documentation.\nSurface sensible heat flux\tJ m-2\tTransfer of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere through the effects of turbulent air motion (but excluding any heat transfer resulting from condensation or evaporation). The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere. This is a single level variable and it is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface solar radiation downwards\tJ m-2\tAmount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth. This variable comprises both direct and diffuse solar radiation. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface (represented by this variable). To a reasonably good approximation, this variable is the model equivalent of what would be measured by a pyranometer (an instrument used for measuring solar radiation) at the surface. However, care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface thermal radiation downwards\tJ m-2\tAmount of thermal (also known as longwave or terrestrial) radiation emitted by the atmosphere and clouds that reaches the Earth's surface. The surface of the Earth emits thermal radiation, some of which is absorbed by the atmosphere and clouds. The atmosphere and clouds likewise emit thermal radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface (represented by this variable). This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nTemperature of snow layer\tK\tThis variable gives the temperature of the snow layer from the ground to the snow-air interface. The ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nTotal precipitation\tm\tAccumulated liquid and frozen water, including rain and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale precipitation (that precipitation which is generated by large-scale weather patterns, such as troughs and cold fronts) and convective precipitation (generated by convection which occurs when air at lower levels in the atmosphere is warmer and less dense than the air above, so it rises). Precipitation variables do not include fog, dew or the precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere before it lands at the surface of the Earth. This variable is accumulated from the beginning of the forecast time to the end of the forecast step. The units of precipitation are depth in metres. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model variables with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box and model time step.\nVolumetric soil water layer 1\tm3 m-3\tVolume of water in soil layer 1 (0 - 7 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System. The surface is at 0 cm. The volumetric soil water is associated with the soil texture (or classification), soil depth, and the underlying groundwater level.\nVolumetric soil water layer 2\tm3 m-3\tVolume of water in soil layer 2 (7 -28 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\nVolumetric soil water layer 3\tm3 m-3\tVolume of water in soil layer 3 (28-100 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System.\nVolumetric soil water layer 4\tm3 m-3\tVolume of water in soil layer 4 (100-289 cm) of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System." ], "Parameters": [ "10m u-component of wind", "10m v-component of wind", "2m dewpoint temperature", "2m temperature", "Evaporation", "Evaporation from bare soil", "Evaporation from open water surfaces excluding oceans", "Evaporation from the top of canopy", "Evaporation from vegetation transpiration", "Forecast albedo", "Lake bottom temperature", "Lake ice depth", "Lake ice temperature", "Lake mix-layer depth", "Lake mix-layer temperature", "Lake shape factor", "Lake total layer temperature", "Leaf area index, high vegetation", "Leaf area index, low vegetation", "Potential evaporation", "Runoff", "Skin reservoir content", "Skin temperature", "Snow albedo", "Snow cover", "Snow density", "Snow depth", "Snow depth water equivalent", "Snow evaporation", "Snowfall", "Snowmelt", "Soil temperature level 1", "Soil temperature level 2", "Soil temperature level 3", "Soil temperature level 4", "Sub-surface runoff", "Surface latent heat flux", "Surface net solar radiation", "Surface net thermal radiation", "Surface pressure", "Surface runoff", "Surface sensible heat flux", "Surface solar radiation downwards", "Surface thermal radiation downwards", "Temperature of snow layer", "Total precipitation", "Volumetric soil water layer 1", "Volumetric soil water layer 2", "Volumetric soil water layer 3", "Volumetric soil water layer 4" ] }

Currently data is available from 1950, split into Climate Data Store entries for 1950-1978 (preliminary back extension) and from 1979 onwards (final release plus timely updates, this page). ERA5 replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis.\n\nReanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities. An uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble at three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience. Such uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which has evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas. To facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too, though monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\n\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. So far this has not been the case and when this does occur users will be notified.\n\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution. It is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access. It should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\n\nAn overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in this article. Information on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in these guidelines.\n\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for the uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves). There are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).\n\nThe present entry is \"ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels from 1979 to present\".\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tRegular latitude-longitude grid.\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\t\n\nReanalysis: 0.25\u00b0 x 0.25\u00b0\n\nMean, spread and members: 0.5\u00b0 x 0.5\u00b0\n\n\nVertical coverage\t1000 hPa to 1 hPa\nVertical resolution\t37 pressure levels\nTemporal coverage\t1979 to present\nTemporal resolution\tHourly\nFile format\tGRIB\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nDivergence\ts-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal divergence of velocity. It is the rate at which air is spreading out horizontally from a point, per square metre. This parameter is positive for air that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for air that is concentrating, or converging (convergence).\nFraction of cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the proportion of a grid box covered by cloud (liquid or ice) and varies between zero and one. This parameter is available on multiple levels through the atmosphere.\nGeopotential\tm2 s-2\tThis parameter is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location, relative to mean sea level. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2). The geopotential height plays an important role in synoptic meteorology (analysis of weather patterns). Charts of geopotential height plotted at constant pressure levels (e.g., 300, 500 or 850 hPa) can be used to identify weather systems such as cyclones, anticyclones, troughs and ridges. At the surface of the Earth, this parameter shows the variations in geopotential (height) of the surface, and is often referred to as the orography.\nOzone mass mixing ratio\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of ozone per kilogram of air. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), there is a simplified representation of ozone chemistry (including representation of the chemistry which has caused the ozone hole). Ozone is also transported around in the atmosphere through the motion of air. Naturally occurring ozone in the stratosphere helps protect organisms at the surface of the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Ozone near the surface, often produced because of pollution, is harmful to organisms. Most of the IFS chemical species are archived as mass mixing ratios [kg kg-1].\nPotential vorticity\tK m2 kg-1 s-1\tPotential vorticity is a measure of the capacity for air to rotate in the atmosphere. If we ignore the effects of heating and friction, potential vorticity is conserved following an air parcel. It is used to look for places where large wind storms are likely to originate and develop. Potential vorticity increases strongly above the tropopause and therefore, it can also be used in studies related to the stratosphere and stratosphere-troposphere exchanges. Large wind storms develop when a column of air in the atmosphere starts to rotate. Potential vorticity is calculated from the wind, temperature and pressure across a column of air in the atmosphere.\nRelative humidity\t%\tThis parameter is the water vapour pressure as a percentage of the value at which the air becomes saturated (the point at which water vapour begins to condense into liquid water or deposition into ice). For temperatures over 0\u00b0C (273.15 K) it is calculated for saturation over water. At temperatures below -23\u00b0C it is calculated for saturation over ice. Between -23\u00b0C and 0\u00b0C this parameter is calculated by interpolating between the ice and water values using a quadratic function.\nSpecific cloud ice water content\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of cloud ice particles per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Water within clouds can be liquid or ice, or a combination of the two. Note that 'cloud frozen water' is the same as 'cloud ice water'.\nSpecific cloud liquid water content\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of cloud liquid water droplets per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Water within clouds can be liquid or ice, or a combination of the two.\nSpecific humidity\tkg kg-1\tThis parameter is the mass of water vapour per kilogram of moist air. The total mass of moist air is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow.\nSpecific rain water content\tkg kg-1\tThe mass of water produced from large-scale clouds that is of raindrop size and so can fall to the surface as precipitation. Large-scale clouds are generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. The quantity is expressed in kilograms per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Clouds contain a continuum of different sized water droplets and ice particles. The IFS cloud scheme simplifies this to represent a number of discrete cloud droplets/particles including cloud water droplets, raindrops, ice crystals and snow (aggregated ice crystals). The processes of droplet formation, phase transition and aggregation are also highly simplified in the IFS.\nSpecific snow water content\tkg kg-1\tThe mass of snow (aggregated ice crystals) produced from large-scale clouds that can fall to the surface as precipitation. Large-scale clouds are generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. The mass is expressed in kilograms per kilogram of the total mass of moist air. The 'total mass of moist air' is the sum of the dry air, water vapour, cloud liquid, cloud ice, rain and falling snow. This parameter represents the average value for a grid box. Clouds contain a continuum of different sized water droplets and ice particles. The IFS cloud scheme simplifies this to represent a number of discrete cloud droplets/particles including cloud water droplets, raindrops, ice crystals and snow (aggregated ice crystals). The processes of droplet formation, phase transition and aggregation are also highly simplified in the IFS.\nTemperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature in the atmosphere. It has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15. This parameter is available on multiple levels through the atmosphere.\nU-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east. A negative sign indicates air moving towards the west. This parameter can be combined with the V component of wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal wind.\nV-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north. A negative sign indicates air moving towards the south. This parameter can be combined with the U component of wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal wind.\nVertical velocity\tPa s-1\tThis parameter is the speed of air motion in the upward or downward direction. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) uses a pressure based vertical co-ordinate system and pressure decreases with height, therefore negative values of vertical velocity indicate upward motion. Vertical velocity can be useful to understand the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere, including areas of upward motion/ascent (negative values) and downward motion/subsidence (positive values).\nVorticity (relative)\ts-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the rotation of air in the horizontal, around a vertical axis, relative to a fixed point on the surface of the Earth. On the scale of weather systems, troughs (weather features that can include rain) are associated with anticlockwise rotation (in the northern hemisphere), and ridges (weather features that bring light or still winds) are associated with clockwise rotation. Adding the effect of rotation of the Earth, the Coriolis parameter, to the relative vorticity produces the absolute vorticity." ], "Parameters": [ "Divergence", "Fraction of cloud cover", "Geopotential", "Ozone mass mixing ratio", "Potential vorticity", "Relative humidity", "Specific cloud ice water content", "Specific cloud liquid water content", "Specific humidity", "Specific rain water content", "Specific snow water content", "Temperature", "U-component of wind", "V-component of wind", "Vertical velocity", "Vorticity (relative)" ] }

Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box. This parameter can be combined with the eastward component to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 100 m wind.\n10m u-component of neutral wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is slower than the actual wind in stable conditions, and faster in unstable conditions. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on land surface properties or the sea state.\n10m u-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). This parameter can be combined with the V component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.\n10m v-component of neutral wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is slower than the actual wind in stable conditions, and faster in unstable conditions. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on land surface properties or the sea state.\n10m v-component of wind\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). This parameter can be combined with the U component of 10m wind to give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.\n10m wind gust since previous post-processing\tm s-1\tMaximum 3 second wind at 10 m height as defined by WMO. Parametrization represents turbulence only before 01102008; thereafter effects of convection are included. The 3 s gust is computed every time step and and the maximum is kept since the last postprocessing.\n2m dewpoint temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur. It is a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature and pressure, it can be used to calculate the relative humidity. 2m dew point temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\n2m temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nAir density over the oceans\tkg m-3\tThis parameter is the mass of air per cubic metre over the oceans, derived from the temperature, specific humidity and pressure at the lowest model level in the atmospheric model. This parameter is one of the parameters used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nAltimeter corrected wave height\tm\tGridded bias corrected altimeter wave height data as presented to the wave model data assimilation scheme. This parameter only exists as type analysis.\nAltimeter range relative correction\tDimensionless\tGridded altimeter range correction as determined from the wave model. This parameter only exists as type analysis.\nAltimeter wave height\tm\tGridded altimeter wave height data as presented to the wave model data assimilation scheme. This parameter only exists as type analysis.\nAngle of sub-gridscale orography\tradians\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, slope and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. The angle of the sub-grid scale orography characterises the geographical orientation of the terrain in the horizontal plane (from a bird's-eye view) relative to an eastwards axis. This parameter does not vary in time.\nAnisotropy of sub-gridscale orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, slope and angle of sub-gridscale orography) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter is a measure of how much the shape of the terrain in the horizontal plane (from a bird's-eye view) is distorted from a circle. A value of one is a circle, less than one an ellipse, and 0 is a ridge. In the case of a ridge, wind blowing parallel to it does not exert any drag on the flow, but wind blowing perpendicular to it exerts the maximum drag. This parameter does not vary in time.\nBenjamin-feir index\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is used to calculate the likelihood of freak ocean waves, which are waves that are higher than twice the mean height of the highest third of waves. Large values of this parameter (in practice of the order 1) indicate increased probability of the occurrence of freak waves. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived from the statistics of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. More precisely, it is the square of the ratio of the integral ocean wave steepness and the relative width of the frequency spectrum of the waves. Further information on the calculation of this parameter is given in Section 10.6 of the ECMWF Wave Model documentation.\nBoundary layer dissipation\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy, into heat, due to small-scale motion in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These small-scale motions are called eddies or turbulence. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nBoundary layer height\tm\tThis parameter is the depth of air next to the Earth's surface which is most affected by the resistance to the transfer of momentum, heat or moisture across the surface. The boundary layer height can be as low as a few tens of metres, such as in cooling air at night, or as high as several kilometres over the desert in the middle of a hot sunny day. When the boundary layer height is low, higher concentrations of pollutants (emitted from the Earth's surface) can develop. The boundary layer height calculation is based on the bulk Richardson number (a measure of the atmospheric conditions) following the conclusions of a 2012 review.\nCharnock\tDimensionless\tThis parameter accounts for increased aerodynamic roughness as wave heights grow due to increasing surface stress. It depends on the wind speed, wave age and other aspects of the sea state and is used to calculate how much the waves slow down the wind. When the atmospheric model is run without the ocean model, this parameter has a constant value of 0.018. When the atmospheric model is coupled to the ocean model, this parameter is calculated by the ECMWF Wave Model.\nClear-sky direct solar radiation at surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of direct radiation from the Sun (also known as solar or shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth, assuming clear-sky (cloudless) conditions. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without being scattered (direct solar radiation). Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nCloud base height\tm\tThe height above the Earth's surface of the base of the lowest cloud layer, at the specified time. This parameter is calculated by searching from the second lowest model level upwards, to the height of the level where cloud fraction becomes greater than 1% and condensate content greater than 1.E-6 kg kg-1. Fog (i.e., cloud in the lowest model layer) is not considered when defining cloud base height.\nCoefficient of drag with waves\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the resistance that ocean waves exert on the atmosphere. It is sometimes also called a \"friction coefficient\". It is calculated by the wave model as the ratio of the square of the friction velocity, to the square of the neutral wind speed at a height of 10 metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and the corresponding roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state.\nConvective available potential energy\tJ kg-1\tThis is an indication of the instability (or stability) of the atmosphere and can be used to assess the potential for the development of convection, which can lead to heavy rainfall, thunderstorms and other severe weather. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), CAPE is calculated by considering parcels of air departing at different model levels below the 350 hPa level. If a parcel of air is more buoyant (warmer and/or with more moisture) than its surrounding environment, it will continue to rise (cooling as it rises) until it reaches a point where it no longer has positive buoyancy. CAPE is the potential energy represented by the total excess buoyancy. The maximum CAPE produced by the different parcels is the value retained. Large positive values of CAPE indicate that an air parcel would be much warmer than its surrounding environment and therefore, very buoyant. CAPE is related to the maximum potential vertical velocity of air within an updraft; thus, higher values indicate greater potential for severe weather. Observed values in thunderstorm environments often may exceed 1000 joules per kilogram (J kg-1), and in extreme cases may exceed 5000 J kg-1. The calculation of this parameter assumes: (i) the parcel of air does not mix with surrounding air; (ii) ascent is pseudo-adiabatic (all condensed water falls out) and (iii) other simplifications related to the mixed-phase condensational heating.\nConvective inhibition\tJ kg-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the amount of energy required for convection to commence. If the value of this parameter is too high, then deep, moist convection is unlikely to occur even if the convective available potential energy or convective available potential energy shear are large. CIN values greater than 200 J kg-1 would be considered high. An atmospheric layer where temperature increases with height (known as a temperature inversion) would inhibit convective uplift and is a situation in which convective inhibition would be large.\nConvective precipitation\tm\tThis parameter is the accumulated precipitation that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Precipitation can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective rain rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of rainfall (rainfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Rainfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the rainfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective snowfall\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated snow that falls to the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Snowfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nConvective snowfall rate water equivalent\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. Snowfall can also be generated by the cloud scheme in the IFS, which represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the snowfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm thick (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nDownward UV radiation at the surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation reaching the surface. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. UV radiation is part of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the Sun that has wavelengths shorter than visible light. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting system (IFS) it is defined as radiation with a wavelength of 0.20-0.44 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre). Small amounts of UV are essential for living organisms, but overexposure may result in cell damage; in humans this includes acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes and immune system. UV radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer, but some reaches the surface. The depletion of the ozone layer is causing concern over an increase in the damaging effects of UV. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nDuct base height\tm\tDuct base height as diagnosed from vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity.\nEastward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in an eastward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nEastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the eastward (westward) direction. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nEvaporation\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from the Earth's surface, including a simplified representation of transpiration (from vegetation), into vapour in the air above. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate condensation.\nForecast albedo\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by Earth's surface, across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. The values of this parameter can range between zero and one. Typically, snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above, land has intermediate values between about 0.1 and 0.4 and the ocean has low values of 0.1 or less. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The remainder is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The portion that is reflected by the Earth's surface depends on the albedo. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a climatological background albedo (observed values averaged over a period of several years) is used, modified by the model over water, ice and snow. Albedo is often shown as a percentage (%).\nForecast logarithm of surface roughness for heat\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the natural logarithm of the roughness length for heat. The surface roughness for heat is a measure of the surface resistance to heat transfer. This parameter is used to determine the air to surface transfer of heat. For given atmospheric conditions, a higher surface roughness for heat means that it is more difficult for the air to exchange heat with the surface. A lower surface roughness for heat means that it is easier for the air to exchange heat with the surface. Over the ocean, surface roughness for heat depends on the waves. Over sea-ice, it has a constant value of 0.001 m. Over land, it is derived from the vegetation type and snow cover.\nForecast surface roughness\tm\tThis parameter is the aerodynamic roughness length in metres. It is a measure of the surface resistance. This parameter is used to determine the air to surface transfer of momentum. For given atmospheric conditions, a higher surface roughness causes a slower near-surface wind speed. Over ocean, surface roughness depends on the waves. Over land, surface roughness is derived from the vegetation type and snow cover.\nFree convective velocity over the oceans\tm s-1\tThis parameter is an estimate of the vertical velocity of updraughts generated by free convection. Free convection is fluid motion induced by buoyancy forces, which are driven by density gradients. The free convective velocity is used to estimate the impact of wind gusts on ocean wave growth. It is calculated at the height of the lowest temperature inversion (the height above the surface of the Earth where the temperature increases with height). This parameter is one of the parameters used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nFriction velocity\tm s-1\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is a theoretical wind speed at the Earth's surface that expresses the magnitude of stress. It is calculated by dividing the surface stress by air density and taking its square root. For turbulent flow, the friction velocity is approximately constant in the lowest few metres of the atmosphere. This parameter increases with the roughness of the surface. It is used to calculate the way wind changes with height in the lowest levels of the atmosphere.\nGravity wave dissipation\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy in the mean flow, into heat, due to the effects of orographic gravity waves. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nHigh cloud cover\tDimensionless\tThe proportion of a grid box covered by cloud occurring in the high levels of the troposphere. High cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure less than 0.45 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), high cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure of less than 450 hPa (approximately 6km and above (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). The high cloud cover parameter is calculated from cloud for the appropriate model levels as described above. Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.\nHigh vegetation cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box that is covered with vegetation that is classified as \"high\". The values vary between 0 and 1 but do not vary in time. This is one of the parameters in the model that describes land surface vegetation. \"High vegetation\" consists of evergreen trees, deciduous trees, mixed forest/woodland, and interrupted forest.\nIce temperature layer 1\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 1 (0 to 7cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 2\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 2 (7 to 28cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 3\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 3 (28 to 100cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nIce temperature layer 4\tK\tThis parameter is the sea-ice temperature in layer 4 (100 to 150cm). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer sea-ice slab: Layer 1: 0-7cm Layer 2: 7-28cm Layer 3: 28-100cm Layer 4: 100-150cm. The temperature of the sea-ice in each layer changes as heat is transferred between the sea-ice layers and the atmosphere above and ocean below.\nInstantaneous 10m wind gust\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the maximum wind gust at the specified time, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The WMO defines a wind gust as the maximum of the wind averaged over 3 second intervals. This duration is shorter than a model time step, and so the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) deduces the magnitude of a gust within each time step from the time-step-averaged surface stress, surface friction, wind shear and stability. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nInstantaneous eastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface at the specified time in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the eastward (westward) direction.\nInstantaneous large-scale surface precipitation fraction\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box (0-1) covered by large-scale precipitation at the specified time. Large-scale precipitation is rain and snow that falls to the Earth's surface, and is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly by the IFS at spatial scales of a grid box or larger. Precipitation can also be due to convection generated by the convection scheme in the IFS. The convection scheme represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box.\nInstantaneous moisture flux\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the net rate of moisture exchange between the land/ocean surface and the atmosphere, due to the processes of evaporation (including evapotranspiration) and condensation, at the specified time. By convention, downward fluxes are positive, which means that evaporation is represented by negative values and condensation by positive values.\nInstantaneous northward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface at the specified time in the northward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the northward (southward) direction.\nInstantaneous surface sensible heat flux\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the transfer of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere, at the specified time, through the effects of turbulent air motion (but excluding any heat transfer resulting from condensation or evaporation). The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nK index\tK\tThis parameter is a measure of the potential for a thunderstorm to develop, calculated from the temperature and dew point temperature in the lower part of the atmosphere. The calculation uses the temperature at 850, 700 and 500 hPa and dewpoint temperature at 850 and 700 hPa. Higher values of K indicate a higher potential for the development of thunderstorms. This parameter is related to the probability of occurrence of a thunderstorm: <20 K No thunderstorm, 20-25 K Isolated thunderstorms, 26-30 K Widely scattered thunderstorms, 31-35 K Scattered thunderstorms, >35 K Numerous thunderstorms.\nLake bottom temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of water at the bottom of inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers and coastal waters). In May 2015, a lake model was implemented in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to represent the water temperature and lake ice of all the world's major inland water bodies.

In cycles of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) from CY41R1 (introduced in May 2015) onwards, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can be comprised of a mixture of land and inland water but not ocean. Grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of a water surface. In the latter case, the lake cover is used to determine how much of the water surface is ocean or inland water. In cycles of the IFS before CY41R1, grid boxes where this parameter has a value above 0.5 can only be comprised of land and those grid boxes with a value of 0.5 and below can only be comprised of ocean.

Rainfall can also be generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the rate the rainfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nLarge scale snowfall rate water equivalent\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity), at the Earth's surface and at the specified time, which is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

Low cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure greater than 0.8 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), low cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure greater than 800 hPa (below approximately 2km (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. This parameter has values from 0 to 1.\nLow vegetation cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of the grid box that is covered with vegetation that is classified as \"low\".

Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nMaximum individual wave height\tm\tThis parameter is an estimate of the height of the expected highest individual wave within a 20 minute time window. It can be used as a guide to the likelihood of extreme or freak waves. The interactions between waves are non-linear and occasionally concentrate wave energy giving a wave height considerably larger than the significant wave height. If the maximum individual wave height is more than twice the significant wave height, then the wave is considered as a freak wave. The significant wave height represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves, generated by local winds and associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived statistically from the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nMaximum total precipitation rate since previous post-processing\tkg m-2 s-1\tThe total precipitation is calculated from the combined large-scale and convective rainfall and snowfall rates every time step and the maximum is kept since the last postprocessing.\nMean boundary layer dissipation\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy, into heat, due to small-scale motion in the lower levels of the atmosphere. These small-scale motions are called eddies or turbulence. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean convective precipitation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of precipitation at the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the precipitation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean convective snowfall rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of snowfall (snowfall intensity) at the Earth's surface, which is generated by the convection scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS).

It is the rate the snowfall would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Since 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm thick (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean direction of total swell\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the mean direction of waves associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of all swell only. It is the mean over all frequencies and directions of the total swell spectrum. The units are degrees true which means the direction relative to the geographic location of the north pole. It is the direction that waves are coming FROM, so zero means \"coming from the north\" and 90 \"coming from the east\".\nMean direction of wind waves\tdegrees\tThe mean direction of waves generated by local winds.

This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in an eastward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean eastward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the stress on the Earth's surface in the eastward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the eastward (westward) direction.

Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate condensation.\nMean gravity wave dissipation\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of energy per unit area that is converted from kinetic energy in the mean flow, into heat, due to the effects of orographic gravity waves. A higher value of this parameter means that more energy is being converted to heat, and so the mean flow is slowing more and the air temperature is rising by a greater amount. Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels.

This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in a northward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System's sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme).

It is the mean over all frequencies and directions of the total wind-sea spectrum.\nMean potential evaporation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is a measure of the extent to which near-surface atmospheric conditions are conducive to the process of evaporation. It is usually considered to be the amount of evaporation, under existing atmospheric conditions, from a surface of pure water which has the temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere and gives an indication of the maximum possible evaporation. Potential evaporation in the current ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) is based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming \"no stress from soil moisture\". In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although potential evaporation is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.\nMean runoff rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is called runoff. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the runoff would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nMean sea level pressure\tPa\tThis parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere at the surface of the Earth, adjusted to the height of mean sea level. It is a measure of the weight that all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface would have, if the point were located at mean sea level. It is calculated over all surfaces - land, sea and inland water. Maps of mean sea level pressure are used to identify the locations of low and high pressure weather systems, often referred to as cyclones and anticyclones. Contours of mean sea level pressure also indicate the strength of the wind. Tightly packed contours show stronger winds. The units of this parameter are pascals (Pa). Mean sea level pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).\nMean snow evaporation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the average rate of snow evaporation from the snow-covered area of a grid box into vapour in the air above.

It is the rate the snow evaporation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second.

This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the runoff would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nMean surface direct short-wave radiation flux\tW m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of direct solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation).

In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting system (IFS) it is defined as radiation with a wavelength of 0.20-0.44 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre). Small amounts of UV are essential for living organisms, but overexposure may result in cell damage; in humans this includes acute and chronic health effects on the skin, eyes and immune system. UV radiation is absorbed by the ozone layer, but some reaches the surface. The depletion of the ozone layer is causing concern over an increase in the damaging effects of UV.

The rest is incident on the Earth's surface (represented by this parameter). To a reasonably good approximation, this parameter is the model equivalent of what would be measured by a pyranometer (an instrument used for measuring solar radiation) at the surface.

The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere.

It is the amount passing through a horizontal plane. Note that the ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards, so a flux from the atmosphere to space will be negative. Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. The thermal radiation emitted to space at the top of the atmosphere is commonly known as the Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) (i.e., taking a flux from the atmosphere to space as positive).

The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nMean total precipitation rate\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of precipitation at the Earth's surface. It is the sum of the rates due to large-scale precipitation and convective precipitation. Large-scale precipitation is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Convective precipitation is generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. It is the rate the precipitation would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nMean vertical gradient of refractivity inside trapping layer\tm-1\tMean vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity inside trapping layer.\nMean vertically integrated moisture divergence\tkg m-2 s-1\tThe vertical integral of the moisture flux is the horizontal rate of flow of moisture (water vapour, cloud liquid and cloud ice), per metre across the flow, for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Its horizontal divergence is the rate of moisture spreading outward from a point, per square metre. This parameter is the mean over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. This parameter is positive for moisture that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for moisture that is concentrating, or converging (convergence). This parameter thus indicates whether atmospheric motions act to decrease (for divergence) or increase (for convergence) the vertical integral of moisture, over the time period. High negative values of this parameter (i.e. large moisture convergence) can be related to precipitation intensification and floods. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm (of liquid water) per second.\nMean wave direction\tdegree true\tThis parameter is the mean direction of ocean/sea surface waves.

Medium cloud is a single level field calculated from cloud occurring on model levels with a pressure between 0.45 and 0.8 times the surface pressure. So, if the surface pressure is 1000 hPa (hectopascal), medium cloud would be calculated using levels with a pressure of less than or equal to 800 hPa and greater than or equal to 450 hPa (between approximately 2km and 6km (assuming a \"standard atmosphere\")). The medium cloud parameter is calculated from cloud cover for the appropriate model levels as described above. Assumptions are made about the degree of overlap/randomness between clouds in different model levels. Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.\nMinimum 2m temperature since previous post-processing\tK\tThis parameter is the lowest temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land, sea or inland waters since the parameter was last archived in a particular forecast. 2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions.

Values of this parameter vary between 0 and 1. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) albedo is dealt with separately for solar radiation with wavelengths greater/less than 0.7\u00b5m and for direct and diffuse solar radiation (giving 4 components to albedo). Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without being scattered (direct solar radiation). In the IFS, a climatological (observed values averaged over a period of several years) background albedo is used which varies from month to month through the year, modified by the model over water, ice and snow.\nNear IR albedo for direct radiation\tDimensionless\tAlbedo is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface.

The energy flux is calculated from an estimation of the loss of wave energy due to white capping waves. A white capping wave is one that appears white at its crest as it breaks, due to air being mixed into the water. When waves break in this way, there is a transfer of energy from the waves to the ocean. Such a flux is defined to be negative. The energy flux has units of Watts per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the cube of the friction velocity.\nNormalized energy flux into waves\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the normalised vertical flux of energy from wind into the ocean waves. A positive flux implies a flux into the waves. The energy flux has units of Watts per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the cube of the friction velocity.\nNormalized stress into ocean\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the normalised surface stress, or momentum flux, from the air into the ocean due to turbulence at the air-sea interface and breaking waves. It does not include the flux used to generate waves. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards. The stress has units of Newtons per metre squared, and this is normalised by being divided by the product of air density and the square of the friction velocity.\nNorthward gravity wave surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the component of the surface stress, in a northward direction, associated with low-level blocking and orographic gravity waves. It is calculated by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System's sub-grid orography scheme. It represents surface stress due to unresolved valleys, hills and mountains with horizontal scales between 5 km and the model grid. (The surface stress associated with orographic features with horizontal scales smaller than 5 km is accounted for by the turbulent orographic form drag scheme). Orographic gravity waves are oscillations in the flow maintained by the buoyancy of displaced air parcels, produced when the air is deflected upwards by hills and mountains. Hills and mountains can also block the flow of air at low levels. Together these processes can create a drag or stress on the atmosphere at the Earth's surface (and at other levels in the atmosphere). This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nNorthward turbulent surface stress\tN m-2 s\tAir flowing over a surface exerts a stress that transfers momentum to the surface and slows the wind. This parameter is the accumulated stress on the Earth's surface in the northward direction due to both the turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface, and to turbulent orographic form drag. The turbulent interactions between the atmosphere and the surface are due to the roughness of the surface. The turbulent orographic form drag is the stress due to the valleys, hills and mountains on horizontal scales below 5km being derived from land surface data at about 1 km resolution. Positive (negative) values denote stress in the northward (southward) direction. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nOcean surface stress equivalent 10m neutral wind direction\tdegrees\tThis parameter is the direction from which the \"neutral wind\" blows, in degrees clockwise from true north, at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state. This parameter is the wind direction used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model's horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nOcean surface stress equivalent 10m neutral wind speed\tm s-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal speed of the \"neutral wind\", at a height of ten metres above the surface of the Earth. The units of this parameter are metres per second. The neutral wind is calculated from the surface stress and roughness length by assuming that the air is neutrally stratified. The neutral wind is, by definition, in the direction of the surface stress. The size of the roughness length depends on the sea state. This parameter is the wind speed used to force the wave model, therefore it is only calculated over water bodies represented in the ocean wave model. It is interpolated from the atmospheric model's horizontal grid onto the horizontal grid used by the ocean wave model.\nOrography\tm2 s-2\tThis parameter is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location at the surface of the Earth, relative to mean sea level and can be referred to as (surface) geopotential. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. The geopotential height can be calculated by dividing the geopotential by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2 ). This parameter does not vary in time.\nPeak wave period\ts\tThis parameter represents the period of the most energetic ocean waves generated by local winds and associated with swell. The wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is calculated from the reciprocal of the frequency corresponding to the largest value (peak) of the frequency wave spectrum. The frequency wave spectrum is obtained by integrating the two-dimensional wave spectrum over all directions. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nPeriod corresponding to maximum individual wave height\ts\tThis parameter is the period of the expected highest individual wave within a 20-minute time window. It can be used as a guide to the characteristics of extreme or freak waves. Wave period is the average time it takes for two consecutive wave crests, on the surface of the ocean/sea, to pass through a fixed point. Occasionally waves of different periods reinforce and interact non-linearly giving a wave height considerably larger than the significant wave height. If the maximum individual wave height is more than twice the significant wave height, then the wave is considered to be a freak wave. The significant wave height represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves, generated by local winds and associated with swell. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). This parameter is derived statistically from the two-dimensional wave spectrum. The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both.\nPotential evaporation\tm\tThis parameter is a measure of the extent to which near-surface atmospheric conditions are conducive to the process of evaporation. It is usually considered to be the amount of evaporation, under existing atmospheric conditions, from a surface of pure water which has the temperature of the lowest layer of the atmosphere and gives an indication of the maximum possible evaporation. Potential evaporation in the current ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) is based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to \"crops/mixed farming\" and assuming \"no stress from soil moisture\". In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although potential evaporation is meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced by dry air. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nPrecipitation type\tDimensionless\tThis parameter describes the type of precipitation at the surface, at the specified time. A precipitation type is assigned wherever there is a non-zero value of precipitation. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) there are only two predicted precipitation variables: rain and snow. Precipitation type is derived from these two predicted variables in combination with atmospheric conditions, such as temperature. Values of precipitation type defined in the IFS: 0 = No precipitation 1 = Rain 3 = Freezing rain (i.e. supercooled raindrops which freeze on contact with the ground and other surfaces) 5 = Snow 6 = Wet snow (i.e. snow particles which are starting to melt) 7 = Mixture of rain and snow 8 = Ice pellets These precipitation types are consistent with WMO Code Table 4.201. 2 (thunderstorm), 4 (mixed ice), 9 (graupel), 10 (hail), 11 (drizzle) and 12 (freezing drizzle) are not diagnosed in the IFS.\nRunoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is called runoff. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of runoff are depth in metres of water. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nSea surface temperature\tK\tThis parameter (SST) is the temperature of sea water near the surface. In ERA5, this parameter is a foundation SST, which means there are no variations due to the daily cycle of the sun (diurnal variations). SST, in ERA5, is given by two external providers. Before September 2007, SST from the HadISST2 dataset is used and from September 2007 onwards, the OSTIA dataset is used. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSea-ice cover\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the fraction of a grid box which is covered by sea ice. Sea ice can only occur in a grid box which includes ocean or inland water according to the land sea mask and lake cover, at the resolution being used. This parameter can be known as sea-ice (area) fraction, sea-ice concentration and more generally as sea-ice cover. In ERA5, sea-ice cover is given by two external providers. Before 1979 the HadISST2 dataset is used. From 1979 to August 2007 the OSI SAF (409a) dataset is used and from September 2007 the OSI SAF oper dataset is used. Sea ice is frozen sea water which floats on the surface of the ocean. Sea ice does not include ice which forms on land such as glaciers, icebergs and ice-sheets. It also excludes ice shelves which are anchored on land, but protrude out over the surface of the ocean. These phenomena are not modelled by the IFS. Long-term monitoring of sea ice is important for understanding climate change. Sea ice also affects shipping routes through the polar regions.\nSignificant height of combined wind waves and swell\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves generated by wind and swell. It represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of both. More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. This parameter can be used to assess sea state and swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant height of total swell\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with swell. It represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of total swell only. More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional total swell spectrum. The total swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant height of wind waves\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves generated by the local wind. It represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of wind-sea waves only. More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the two-dimensional wind-sea wave spectrum. The wind-sea wave spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are still under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess wind-sea waves. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant wave height of first swell partition\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with the first swell partition. Wave height represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the first might be from one system at one location and another system at the neighbouring location). More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the first swell partition of the two-dimensional swell spectrum. The swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant wave height of second swell partition\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with the second swell partition. Wave height represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the second might be from one system at one location and another system at the neighbouring location). More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the first swell partition of the two-dimensional swell spectrum. The swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSignificant wave height of third swell partition\tm\tThis parameter represents the average height of the highest third of surface ocean/sea waves associated with the third swell partition. Wave height represents the vertical distance between the wave crest and the wave trough. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. In many situations, swell can be made up of different swell systems, for example, from two distant and separate storms. To account for this, the swell spectrum is partitioned into up to three parts. The swell partitions are labelled first, second and third based on their respective wave height. Therefore, there is no guarantee of spatial coherence (the third might be from one system at one location and another system at the neighbouring location). More strictly, this parameter is four times the square root of the integral over all directions and all frequencies of the first swell partition of the two-dimensional swell spectrum. The swell spectrum is obtained by only considering the components of the two-dimensional wave spectrum that are not under the influence of the local wind. This parameter can be used to assess swell. For example, engineers use significant wave height to calculate the load on structures in the open ocean, such as oil platforms, or in coastal applications.\nSkin reservoir content\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the amount of water in the vegetation canopy and/or in a thin layer on the soil. It represents the amount of rain intercepted by foliage, and water from dew. The maximum amount of \"skin reservoir content\" a grid box can hold depends on the type of vegetation, and may be zero. Water leaves the \"skin reservoir\" by evaporation.\nSkin temperature\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the surface of the Earth. The skin temperature is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface fluxes. Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSlope of sub-gridscale orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being standard deviation, angle and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter represents the slope of the sub-grid valleys, hills and mountains. A flat surface has a value of 0, and a 45 degree slope has a value of 0.5. This parameter does not vary in time.\nSnow albedo\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a measure of the reflectivity of the snow-covered part of the grid box. It is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by snow across the solar spectrum. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. This parameter changes with snow age and also depends on vegetation height. It has a range of values between 0 and 1. For low vegetation, it ranges between 0.52 for old snow and 0.88 for fresh snow. For high vegetation with snow underneath, it depends on vegetation type and has values between 0.27 and 0.38.\nSnow density\tkg m-3\tThis parameter is the mass of snow per cubic metre in the snow layer. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow depth\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the amount of snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box. Its units are metres of water equivalent, so it is the depth the water would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the whole grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box.\nSnow evaporation\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from snow from the snow-covered area of a grid box into vapour in the air above. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. This parameter is the depth of water there would be if the evaporated snow (from the snow-covered area of a grid box) were liquid and were spread evenly over the whole grid box. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The IFS convention is that downward fluxes are positive. Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate deposition.\nSnowfall\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated snow that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale snowfall and convective snowfall. Large-scale snowfall is generated by the cloud scheme in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS). The cloud scheme represents the formation and dissipation of clouds and large-scale precipitation due to changes in atmospheric quantities (such as pressure, temperature and moisture) predicted directly at spatial scales of the grid box or larger. Convective snowfall is generated by the convection scheme in the IFS, which represents convection at spatial scales smaller than the grid box. In the IFS, precipitation is comprised of rain and snow. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nSnowmelt\tm of water equivalent\tThis parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has melted from snow in the snow-covered area of a grid box. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) represents snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the grid box. This parameter is the depth of water there would be if the melted snow (from the snow-covered area of a grid box) were spread evenly over the whole grid box. For example, if half the grid box were covered in snow with a water equivalent depth of 0.02m, this parameter would have a value of 0.01m. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time.\nSoil temperature level 1\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the soil at level 1 (in the middle of layer 1). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer representation of soil, where the surface is at 0cm: Layer 1: 0 - 7cm Layer 2: 7 - 28cm Layer 3: 28 - 100cm Layer 4: 100 - 289cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSoil temperature level 2\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the soil at level 2 (in the middle of layer 2). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer representation of soil, where the surface is at 0cm: Layer 1: 0 - 7cm Layer 2: 7 - 28cm Layer 3: 28 - 100cm Layer 4: 100 - 289cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSoil temperature level 3\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the soil at level 3 (in the middle of layer 3). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer representation of soil, where the surface is at 0cm: Layer 1: 0 - 7cm Layer 2: 7 - 28cm Layer 3: 28 - 100cm Layer 4: 100 - 289cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSoil temperature level 4\tK\tThis parameter is the temperature of the soil at level 4 (in the middle of layer 4). The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) has a four-layer representation of soil, where the surface is at 0cm: Layer 1: 0 - 7cm Layer 2: 7 - 28cm Layer 3: 28 - 100cm Layer 4: 100 - 289cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (\u00b0C) by subtracting 273.15.\nSoil type\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is the texture (or classification) of soil used by the land surface scheme of the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) to predict the water holding capacity of soil in soil moisture and runoff calculations. It is derived from the root zone data (30-100 cm below the surface) of the FAO/UNESCO Digital Soil Map of the World, DSMW (FAO, 2003), which exists at a resolution of 5' X 5' (about 10 km). The seven soil types are: Coarse 1 Medium 2 Medium fine 3 Fine 4 Very fine 5 Organic 6 Tropical organic 7 This parameter does not vary in time.\nStandard deviation of filtered subgrid orography\tm\tClimatological parameter (scales between approximately 3 and 22 km are included). This parameter does not vary in time.\nStandard deviation of orography\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is one of four parameters (the others being angle of sub-gridscale orography, slope and anisotropy) that describe the features of the orography that are too small to be resolved by the model grid. These four parameters are calculated for orographic features with horizontal scales comprised between 5 km and the model grid resolution, being derived from the height of valleys, hills and mountains at about 1 km resolution. They are used as input for the sub-grid orography scheme which represents low-level blocking and orographic gravity wave effects. This parameter represents the standard deviation of the height of the sub-grid valleys, hills and mountains within a grid box. This parameter does not vary in time.\nSub-surface runoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is called runoff. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of runoff are depth in metres of water. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nSurface latent heat flux\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the transfer of latent heat (resulting from water phase changes, such as evaporation or condensation) between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere through the effects of turbulent air motion. Evaporation from the Earth's surface represents a transfer of energy from the surface to the atmosphere. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface net solar radiation\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) that reaches a horizontal plane at the surface of the Earth (both direct and diffuse) minus the amount reflected by the Earth's surface (which is governed by the albedo). Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The remainder is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface net solar radiation, clear sky\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of solar (shortwave) radiation reaching the surface of the Earth (both direct and diffuse) minus the amount reflected by the Earth's surface (which is governed by the albedo), assuming clear-sky (cloudless) conditions. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it is reflected. The difference between downward and reflected solar radiation is the surface net solar radiation. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface net thermal radiation\tJ m-2\tThermal radiation (also known as longwave or terrestrial radiation) refers to radiation emitted by the atmosphere, clouds and the surface of the Earth. This parameter is the difference between downward and upward thermal radiation at the surface of the Earth. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. The atmosphere and clouds emit thermal radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface as downward thermal radiation. The upward thermal radiation at the surface consists of thermal radiation emitted by the surface plus the fraction of downwards thermal radiation reflected upward by the surface. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface net thermal radiation, clear sky\tJ m-2\tThermal radiation (also known as longwave or terrestrial radiation) refers to radiation emitted by the atmosphere, clouds and the surface of the Earth. This parameter is the difference between downward and upward thermal radiation at the surface of the Earth, assuming clear-sky (cloudless) conditions. It is the amount of radiation passing through a horizontal plane. Clear-sky radiation quantities are computed for exactly the same atmospheric conditions of temperature, humidity, ozone, trace gases and aerosol as the corresponding total-sky quantities (clouds included), but assuming that the clouds are not there. The atmosphere and clouds emit thermal radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface as downward thermal radiation. The upward thermal radiation at the surface consists of thermal radiation emitted by the surface plus the fraction of downwards thermal radiation reflected upward by the surface. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units are joules per square metre (J m-2 ). To convert to watts per square metre (W m-2 ), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds. The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.\nSurface pressure\tPa\tThis parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere at the surface of land, sea and inland water. It is a measure of the weight of all the air in a column vertically above a point on the Earth's surface. Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature to calculate air density. The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes it difficult to see the low and high pressure weather systems over mountainous areas, so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used for this purpose. The units of this parameter are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars, mb (1 hPa = 1 mb= 100 Pa).\nSurface runoff\tm\tSome water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two is called runoff. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of runoff are depth in metres of water. This is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point rather than averaged over a grid box. Observations are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.\nSurface sensible heat flux\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the transfer of heat between the Earth's surface and the atmosphere through the effects of turbulent air motion (but excluding any heat transfer resulting from condensation or evaporation). The magnitude of the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness. For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time.

This parameter comprises both direct and diffuse solar radiation. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface (represented by this parameter). To a reasonably good approximation, this parameter is the model equivalent of what would be measured by a pyranometer (an instrument used for measuring solar radiation) at the surface. However, care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.

Cloud fractions vary from 0 to 1.\nTotal column cloud ice water\tkg m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of ice contained within clouds in a column extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Snow (aggregated ice crystals) is not included in this parameter. This parameter represents the area averaged value for a model grid box. Clouds contain a continuum of different sized water droplets and ice particles. The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) cloud scheme simplifies this to represent a number of discrete cloud droplets/particles including: cloud water droplets, raindrops, ice crystals and snow (aggregated ice crystals).

This parameter can also be referred to as total ozone, or vertically integrated ozone. The values are dominated by ozone within the stratosphere. In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), there is a simplified representation of ozone chemistry (including representation of the chemistry which has caused the ozone hole). Ozone is also transported around in the atmosphere through the motion of air. Naturally occurring ozone in the stratosphere helps protect organisms at the surface of the Earth from the harmful effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. Ozone near the surface, often produced because of pollution, is harmful to organisms. In the IFS, the units for total ozone are kilograms per square metre, but before 12/06/2001 dobson units were used.

For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. The units of this parameter are depth in metres of water equivalent. It is the depth the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a model grid box.\nTotal sky direct solar radiation at surface\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the amount of direct solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation) reaching the surface of the Earth.

The total totals index is the temperature difference between 850 hPa (near surface) and 500 hPa (mid-troposphere) (lapse rate) plus a measure of the moisture content between 850 hPa and 500 hPa. The probability of deep convection tends to increase with increasing lapse rate and atmospheric moisture content. There are a number of limitations to this index. Also, the interpretation of the index value varies with season and location.\nTrapping layer base height\tm\tTrapping layer base height as diagnosed from vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity.\nTrapping layer top height\tm\tTrapping layer top height as diagnosed from vertical gradient of atmospheric refractivity.\nType of high vegetation\tDimensionless\tThis parameter indicates the 6 types of high vegetation recognised by the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System: 3 = Evergreen needleleaf trees 4 = Deciduous needleleaf trees 5 = Deciduous broadleaf trees 6 = Evergreen broadleaf trees 18 = Mixed forest/woodland 19 = Interrupted forest.

This parameter is the fraction of diffuse solar (shortwave) radiation with wavelengths between 0.3 and 0.7 \u00b5m (microns, 1 millionth of a metre) reflected by the Earth's surface (for snow-free land surfaces only). In the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) albedo is dealt with separately for solar radiation with wavelengths greater/less than 0.7\u00b5m and for direct and diffuse solar radiation (giving 4 components to albedo). Solar radiation at the surface can be direct or diffuse. Solar radiation can be scattered in all directions by particles in the atmosphere, some of which reaches the surface (diffuse solar radiation). Some solar radiation reaches the surface without being scattered (direct solar radiation). In the IFS, a climatological (observed values averaged over a period of several years) background albedo is used which varies from month to month through the year, modified by the model over water, ice and snow.

The thermal energy is equal to enthalpy, which is the sum of the internal energy and the energy associated with the pressure of the air on its surroundings. Internal energy is the energy contained within a system i.e., the microscopic energy of the air molecules, rather than the macroscopic energy associated with, for example, wind, or gravitational potential energy. The energy associated with the pressure of the air on its surroundings is the energy required to make room for the system by displacing its surroundings and is calculated from the product of pressure and volume.

Negative values indicate a conversion to kinetic energy from potential plus internal energy. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric energy budget. The circulation of the atmosphere can also be considered in terms of energy conversions.\nVertical integral of kinetic energy\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the vertical integral of kinetic energy for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Atmospheric kinetic energy is the energy of the atmosphere due to its motion. Only horizontal motion is considered in the calculation of this parameter. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric energy budget.\nVertical integral of mass of atmosphere\tkg m-2\tThis parameter is the total mass of air for a column extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere, per square metre. This parameter is calculated by dividing surface pressure by the Earth's gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2 ), and has units of kilograms per square metre. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric mass budget.\nVertical integral of mass tendency\tkg m-2 s-1\tThis parameter is the rate of change of the mass of a column of air extending from the Earth's surface to the top of the atmosphere. An increasing mass of the column indicates rising surface pressure. In contrast, a decrease indicates a falling surface pressure. The mass of the column is calculated by dividing pressure at the Earth's surface by the gravitational acceleration, g (=9.80665 m s-2 ). This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric mass and energy budgets.\nVertical integral of northward cloud frozen water flux\tkg m-1 s-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal rate of flow of cloud frozen water, in the northward direction, per metre across the flow, for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere.

Positive values indicate a flux from south to north. Geopotential is the gravitational potential energy of a unit mass, at a particular location, relative to mean sea level. It is also the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift a unit mass to that location from mean sea level. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric energy budget.\nVertical integral of northward heat flux\tW m-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal rate of flow of heat in the northward direction, per metre across the flow, for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Positive values indicate a flux from south to north. Heat (or thermal energy) is equal to enthalpy, which is the sum of the internal energy and the energy associated with the pressure of the air on its surroundings. Internal energy is the energy contained within a system i.e., the microscopic energy of the air molecules, rather than the macroscopic energy associated with, for example, wind, or gravitational potential energy. The energy associated with the pressure of the air on its surroundings is the energy required to make room for the system by displacing its surroundings and is calculated from the product of pressure and volume. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric energy budget.\nVertical integral of northward kinetic energy flux\tW m-1\tThis parameter is the horizontal rate of flow of kinetic energy, in the northward direction, per metre across the flow, for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere.

The potential energy of an air parcel is the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift the air to that location from mean sea level. Internal energy is the energy contained within a system i.e., the microscopic energy of the air molecules, rather than the macroscopic energy associated with, for example, wind, or gravitational potential energy. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric energy budget. Total atmospheric energy is made up of internal, potential, kinetic and latent energy.\nVertical integral of potential, internal and latent energy\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the mass weighted vertical integral of potential, internal and latent energy for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. The potential energy of an air parcel is the amount of work that would have to be done, against the force of gravity, to lift the air to that location from mean sea level. Internal energy is the energy contained within a system i.e., the microscopic energy of the air molecules, rather than the macroscopic energy associated with, for example, wind, or gravitational potential energy. The latent energy refers to the energy associated with the water vapour in the atmosphere and is equal to the energy required to convert liquid water into water vapour. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric energy budget. Total atmospheric energy is made up of internal, potential, kinetic and latent energy.\nVertical integral of temperature\tK kg m-2\tThis parameter is the mass-weighted vertical integral of temperature for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric energy budget.\nVertical integral of thermal energy\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the mass-weighted vertical integral of thermal energy for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Thermal energy is calculated from the product of temperature and the specific heat capacity of air at constant pressure. The thermal energy is equal to enthalpy, which is the sum of the internal energy and the energy associated with the pressure of the air on its surroundings. Internal energy is the energy contained within a system i.e., the microscopic energy of the air molecules, rather than the macroscopic energy associated with, for example, wind, or gravitational potential energy. The energy associated with the pressure of the air on its surroundings is the energy required to make room for the system by displacing its surroundings and is calculated from the product of pressure and volume. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric energy budget. Total atmospheric energy is made up of internal, potential, kinetic and latent energy.\nVertical integral of total energy\tJ m-2\tThis parameter is the vertical integral of total energy for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Total atmospheric energy is made up of internal, potential, kinetic and latent energy. This parameter can be used to study the atmospheric energy budget.\nVertically integrated moisture divergence\tkg m-2\tThe vertical integral of the moisture flux is the horizontal rate of flow of moisture (water vapour, cloud liquid and cloud ice), per metre across the flow, for a column of air extending from the surface of the Earth to the top of the atmosphere. Its horizontal divergence is the rate of moisture spreading outward from a point, per square metre. This parameter is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. For the reanalysis, the accumulation period is over the 1 hour up to the validity date and time. For the ensemble members, ensemble mean and ensemble spread, the accumulation period is over the 3 hours up to the validity date and time. This parameter is positive for moisture that is spreading out, or diverging, and negative for the opposite, for moisture that is concentrating, or converging (convergence). This parameter thus indicates whether atmospheric motions act to decrease (for divergence) or increase (for convergence) the vertical integral of moisture, over the time period. High negative values of this parameter (i.e. large moisture convergence) can be related to precipitation intensification and floods. 1 kg of water spread over 1 square metre of surface is 1 mm deep (neglecting the effects of temperature on the density of water), therefore the units are equivalent to mm.\nVolumetric soil water layer 1\tm3 m-3\tThis parameter is the volume of water in soil layer 1 (0 - 7cm, the surface is at 0cm).

The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System model has a four-layer representation of soil: Layer 1: 0 - 7cm Layer 2: 7 - 28cm Layer 3: 28 - 100cm Layer 4: 100 - 289cm. The volumetric soil water is associated with the soil texture (or classification), soil depth, and the underlying groundwater level.\nWave spectral directional width\tDimensionless\tThis parameter indicates whether waves (generated by local winds and associated with swell) are coming from similar directions or from a wide range of directions. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). Many ECMWF wave parameters (such as the mean wave period) give information averaged over all wave frequencies and directions, so do not give any information about the distribution of wave energy across frequencies and directions. This parameter gives more information about the nature of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. This parameter is a measure of the range of wave directions for each frequency integrated across the two-dimensional spectrum. This parameter takes values between 0 and the square root of 2. Where 0 corresponds to a uni-directional spectrum (i.e., all wave frequencies from the same direction) and the square root of 2 indicates a uniform spectrum (i.e., all wave frequencies from a different direction).\nWave spectral directional width for swell\tDimensionless\tThis parameter indicates whether waves associated with swell are coming from similar directions or from a wide range of directions. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of all swell only. Many ECMWF wave parameters (such as the mean wave period) give information averaged over all wave frequencies and directions, so do not give any information about the distribution of wave energy across frequencies and directions. This parameter gives more information about the nature of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. This parameter is a measure of the range of wave directions for each frequency integrated across the two-dimensional spectrum. This parameter takes values between 0 and the square root of 2. Where 0 corresponds to a uni-directional spectrum (i.e., all wave frequencies from the same direction) and the square root of 2 indicates a uniform spectrum (i.e., all wave frequencies from a different direction).\nWave spectral directional width for wind waves\tDimensionless\tThis parameter indicates whether waves generated by the local wind are coming from similar directions or from a wide range of directions. The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). The wave spectrum can be decomposed into wind-sea waves, which are directly affected by local winds, and swell, the waves that were generated by the wind at a different location and time. This parameter takes account of wind-sea waves only. Many ECMWF wave parameters (such as the mean wave period) give information averaged over all wave frequencies and directions, so do not give any information about the distribution of wave energy across frequencies and directions. This parameter gives more information about the nature of the two-dimensional wave spectrum. This parameter is a measure of the range of wave directions for each frequency integrated across the two-dimensional spectrum. This parameter takes values between 0 and the square root of 2. Where 0 corresponds to a uni-directional spectrum (i.e., all wave frequencies from the same direction) and the square root of 2 indicates a uniform spectrum (i.e., all wave frequencies from a different direction).\nWave spectral kurtosis\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a statistical measure used to forecast extreme or freak ocean/sea waves. It describes the nature of the sea surface elevation and how it is affected by waves generated by local winds and associated with swell. Under typical conditions, the sea surface elevation, as described by its probability density function, has a near normal distribution in the statistical sense. However, under certain wave conditions the probability density function of the sea surface elevation can deviate considerably from normality, signalling increased probability of freak waves. This parameter gives one measure of the deviation from normality. It shows how much of the probability density function of the sea surface elevation exists in the tails of the distribution. So, a positive kurtosis (typical range 0.0 to 0.06) means more frequent occurrences of very extreme values (either above or below the mean), relative to a normal distribution.\nWave spectral peakedness\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a statistical measure used to forecast extreme or freak waves. It is a measure of the relative width of the ocean/sea wave frequency spectrum (i.e., whether the ocean/sea wave field is made up of a narrow or broad range of frequencies). The ocean/sea surface wave field consists of a combination of waves with different heights, lengths and directions (known as the two-dimensional wave spectrum). When the wave field is more focussed around a narrow range of frequencies, the probability of freak/extreme waves increases. This parameter is Goda's peakedness factor and is used to calculate the Benjamin-Feir Index (BFI). The BFI is in turn used to estimate the probability and nature of extreme/freak waves.\nWave spectral skewness\tDimensionless\tThis parameter is a statistical measure used to forecast extreme or freak ocean/sea waves. It describes the nature of the sea surface elevation and how it is affected by waves generated by local winds and associated with swell. Under typical conditions, the sea surface elevation, as described by its probability density function, has a near normal distribution in the statistical sense. However, under certain wave conditions the probability density function of the sea surface elevation can deviate considerably from normality, signalling increased probability of freak waves. This parameter gives one measure of the deviation from normality. It is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability density function of the sea surface elevation. So, a positive/negative skewness (typical range -0.2 to 0.12) means more frequent occurrences of extreme values above/below the mean, relative to a normal distribution.\nZero degree level\tm\tThe height above the Earth's surface where the temperature passes from positive to negative values, corresponding to the top of a warm layer, at the specified time. This parameter can be used to help forecast snow. If more than one warm layer is encountered, then the zero degree level corresponds to the top of the second atmospheric layer. This parameter is set to zero when the temperature in the whole atmosphere is below 0\u2103." ], "Parameters": [ "100m u-component of wind", "100m v-component of wind", "10m u-component of neutral

{ "Webpage": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-sea-ice-concentration", "Title": "ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1979 to present", "Description": [ "This dataset provides daily gridded data of sea ice concentration for both hemispheres derived from satellite passive microwave brightness temperatures. Sea ice is an important component of our climate system and a sensitive indicator of climate change. Its presence or its retreat has a strong impact on air-sea interactions, the Earth\u2019s energy budget as well as marine ecosystems. It is recognised by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable. Sea ice concentration is defined as the fraction of a pixel or grid cell in a satellite image or other gridded product that is covered with sea ice. It is one of the parameters commonly used to characterise sea ice. Other sea ice parameters include sea ice thickness, sea ice edge, and sea ice type, also available in the Climate Data Store.\n\nThe dataset consists of two products:\n\nThe Global Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record produced by the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF). This is a coarse-resolution product based on measurements from the following sensors: Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR; 1979\u20131987), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I; 1987\u20132006), and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS; 2005 onward). This product spans the period from 1979 to present and is updated daily. In the following, it is referred to as the SSMIS product.\nThe Global Sea Ice Concentration Climate Data Record produced by the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative Phase 2 project (ESA CCI). This is a medium-resolution product based on measurements from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor (2002\u20132011) and its successor, AMSR2 (2012\u20132017). This product spans the 2002\u20132017 period and is not updated. In the following, it is referred to as the AMSR product.\n\nBoth products are provided on the same polar projection with a grid resolution of 25 km. However, the AMSR product has a true spatial resolution (as resolved by the sensor) of about 15\u201325 km versus 30\u201360 km for the SSMIS product. Therefore, the AMSR product provides a much more detailed view of the sea ice cover than the SSMIS product, especially along the marginal ice zone, the transitional zone between open water and the dense sea ice pack. On the other hand, the clear strength of the SSMIS product is its more than 40-year long and consistent record with daily updates.\n\nAlthough originating from different projects, the two products share the same algorithm baseline, which is both a continuation of the EUMETSAT OSI SAF approach and a series of innovations contributed mostly by ESA CCI activities. For both products, the underlying algorithm makes use of a combination of the same three temperature channels near 19 GHz and 37 GHz. The data also share a common data format so that interested users can revert some of the filtering steps and access the raw output of the SIC algorithms. Both are level-4 products in the sense that gaps are filled by temporal and spatial interpolation. However, gap filling is not applied to fill in days when no input satellite data are available.\n\nFurther details about each product can be found below as well as in the Documentation section.", "\n\n  \n    This section provides further details about the coarse-resolution sea ice concentration product produced by EUMETSAT OSI SAF and based on measurements from the series of SMMR, SSM/I, and SSMIS sensors. As other datasets in the Climate Data Store, this product combines a Climate Data Record (CDR), which has sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to be used to assess climate variability and change, and an Interim Climate Data Record (ICDR), which provides regular temporal extensions to the CDR. The consistency of the ICDR with the CDR is checked at best for an overlapping period but cannot be guaranteed during live production of the ICDR. The product version provided here is version 2.0. The CDR spans January 1979 to December 2015 and corresponds to OSI SAF product ID OSI-450.

{ "Webpage": "https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/satellite-sea-ice-edge-type", "Title": "Sea ice concentration daily gridded data from 1979 to present derived from satellite observations", "Description": [ "This dataset provides daily gridded data of sea ice edge and sea ice type derived from brightness temperatures measured by satellite passive microwave radiometers. Sea ice is an important component of our climate system and a sensitive indicator of climate change. Its presence or its retreat has a strong impact on air-sea interactions, the Earth\u2019s energy budget as well as marine ecosystems. It is recognized by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable. Sea ice edge and type are some of the parameters used to characterise sea ice. Other parameters include sea ice concentration and sea ice thickness, also available in the Climate Data Store.\n\nSea ice edge and type are defined as follows:\n\nSea ice edge classifies the sea surface into open water, open ice, and closed ice depending on the amount of sea ice present in each grid cell. This variable is provided for both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Note that a sea ice concentration threshold of 30% is used to distinguish between open water and open ice, which differs from the 15% threshold commonly used for other sea ice products such as sea ice extent.\nSea ice type classifies ice-covered areas into two categories based on the age of the sea ice: multiyear ice versus seasonal first-year ice. This variable is currently only available for the Northern Hemisphere and limited to the extended boreal winter months (October through April). Sea ice type classification during summer is difficult due to the effect of melting at the ice surface which disturbs the passive microwave signature.\n\nBoth sea ice products are based on measurements from the series of Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I), and Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) sensors and share the same algorithm baseline. However, sea ice edge makes use of two lower frequencies near 19 GHz and 37 GHz and a higher frequency near 90 GHz whereas sea ice type only uses the two lower frequencies. This dataset combines Climate Data Records (CDRs), which are intended to have sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to assess climate variability and change, and Interim Climate Data Records (ICDRs), which provide regular temporal extensions to the CDRs and where consistency with the CDRs is expected but not extensively checked. For this dataset, both the CDR and ICDR parts of each product were generated using the same software and algorithms.\n\nThe CDRs of sea ice edge and type currently extend from January 1979 to December 2015 whereas the corresponding ICDRs extend from January 2016 to present (with a 16-day latency behind real time). All data from the current release of the datasets (version 1.0) are Level 3 products. The next product release (version 2.0) will provide Level 4 products as well, in which gaps will be filled by temporal and spatial interpolation.\n\nThis dataset is produced on behalf of Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), with heritage from the operational products generated by EUMETSAT Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSI SAF).\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nProjection\tLambert Azimuthal Equal Area (EASE-Grid verion 2.0) centred over poles\nHorizontal coverage\tSea ice edge: Northern and Southern Hemispheres\nSea ice type: Northern Hemisphere only\nHorizontal resolution\tSea ice edge: 12.5 km grid resolution (true spatial resolution as resolved by sensor: ~15 km)\nSea ice type: 25 km grid resolution (true spatial resolution as resolved by sensor: 30-60 km)\nVertical coverage\tSurface\nVertical resolution\tSingle level\nTemporal coverage\t2 January 1979 to present\nTemporal resolution\tDaily (every second day prior to 9 July 1987)\nFile format\tNetCDF 4\nConventions\tClimate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Convention v1.6, Attribute Convention for Dataset Discovery (ACDD) v1.3\nVersions\tv1.0 (new version expected in 2021)\nUpdate frequency\tDaily (with a 16-day latency)\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\tDescription\nSea ice edge\tDimensionless\tClassification of the sea surface based on sea ice concentration (SIC) values.
