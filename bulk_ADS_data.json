Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nThe assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The atmosphere model allows for estimates at locations where data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available. The provision of estimates at each grid point around the globe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with.\n\nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates. For this reason, EAC4 is only available from 2003 onwards.\n\nAlthough the analysis procedure considers chunks of data in a window of 12 hours in one go, EAC4 provides estimates every 3 hours, worldwide. This is made possible by the 4D-Var assimilation method, which takes account of the exact timing of the observations and model evolution within the assimilation window.\n\nMore details about the products are given in the Documentation section.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\t0.75\u00b0x0.75\u00b0\nVertical coverage\tTotal column, model levels 60, pressure levels 1000, 950, 925, 900, 850, 800, 700, 600, 500, 400, 300, 250, 200, 150, 100, 70, 50, 30, 20, 10, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1 hPa\nTemporal coverage\t2003 to 2020\nTemporal resolution\tmonthly\nFile format\tGRIB, NetCDF\nUpdate frequency\tTwice a year with 4-6 month delay\n\nMAIN VARIABLES\nName\tUnits\n2m dewpoint temperature\tK\n2m temperature\tK\nBlack carbon aerosol optical depth at 550 nm\t~\nCarbon monoxide\tkg kg-1\nCharnock\t~\nDust aerosol (0.03 -

Such information has been used in particular as part of the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Ground-based and satellite remote-sensing observations provide a means to quantifying the net fluxes between the land and ocean on the one hand and the atmosphere on the other hand. This is done through a process called atmospheric inversion, which uses transport models of the atmosphere to link the observed concentrations of CO2, CH4 and N2O to the net fluxes at the Earth's surface. By correctly modelling the winds, vertical diffusion, and convection in the global atmosphere, the observed concentrations of the greenhouse gases are used to infer the surface fluxes for the last few decades. For CH4 and N2O, the flux inversions account also for the chemical loss of these greenhouse gases. The net fluxes include contributions from the natural biosphere (e.g., vegetation, wetlands) as well anthropogenic contributions (e.g., fossil fuel emissions, rice fields).\n\nThe data sets for the three species are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency. This is reflected by the different version numbers.

CAMS compiles inventories of emission data that serve as input to its own forecast models, but which can also be used by other atmospheric chemical transport models. These inventories are based on a combination of existing data sets and new information, describing anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel use on land, shipping, and aviation, and natural emissions from vegetation, soil, the ocean and termites. The anthropogenic emissions on land are further separated in specific activity sectors (e.g., power generation, road traffic, industry). The CAMS emission data sets provide good consistency between the emissions of greenhouse gases, reactive gases, and aerosol particles and their precursors. Because most inventory-based data sets are only available with a delay of several years, the CAMS emission inventories also extend these existing data sets forward in time by using the trends from the most recent available years, producing timely input data for real-time forecast models.\n\nMost of the data sets are updated once or twice per year adding the most recent year to the data record, while re-processing the original data record for consistency, when needed.

In contrast, concurrent changes in atmospheric aerosol concentrations are thought to exert a negative RF leading to a loss of energy.\n\nProducts are quantified both in \u201call-sky\u201d conditions, meaning that the radiative effects of clouds are included in the radiative transfer calculations, and in \u201cclear-sky\u201d conditions, which are computed by excluding clouds in the radiative transfer calculations.\n\nThe upgrade from version 1.5 to 2 consists of an extension of the period by 2017-2018, the addition of an \"effective radiative forcing\" product and new ways to calculate the pre-industrial reference state for aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei. More details are given in the documentation section. New versions may be released in future as scientific methods develop, and existing versions may be extended with later years if data for the period is available from the CAMS reanalysis. Newer versions supercede old versions so it is always recommended to use the latest one.\n\nCAMS also produces distributions of aerosol optical depths, distinguishing natural from anthropogenic aerosols, which are a separate dataset.

{ "Webpage": "https://ads.atmosphere.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/cams-global-reanalysis-eac4", "Title": "CAMS global reanalysis (EAC4)", "Description": [ "EAC4 (ECMWF Atmospheric Composition Reanalysis 4) is the fourth generation ECMWF global reanalysis of atmospheric composition. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using a model of the atmosphere based on the laws of physics and chemistry. This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres and air quality forecasting centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back more than a decade. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nThe assimilation system is able to estimate biases between observations and to sift good-quality data from poor data. The atmosphere model allows for estimates at locations where data coverage is low or for atmospheric pollutants for which no direct observations are available. The provision of estimates at each grid point around the globe for each regular output time, over a long period, always using the same format, makes reanalysis a very convenient and popular dataset to work with.\n\nThe observing system has changed drastically over time, and although the assimilation system can resolve data holes, the initially much sparser networks will lead to less accurate estimates. For this reason, EAC4 is only available from 2003 onwards.\n\nAlthough the analysis procedure considers chunks of data in a window of 12 hours in one go, EAC4 provides estimates every 3 hours, worldwide. This is made possible by the 4D-Var assimilation method, which takes account of the exact timing of the observations and model evolution within the assimilation window.\n\nMore details about the products are given in the Documentation section.\n\nDATA DESCRIPTION\nData type\tGridded\nHorizontal coverage\tGlobal\nHorizontal resolution\t0.75\u00b0x0.75\u00b0\nVertical coverage\tSurface, total column, model levels and pressure levels.\nVertical resolution\t60 model levels.
